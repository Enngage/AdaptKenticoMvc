Transcript","inlineTranscriptBody":"<h1>Overview of Kentico MVC Architecture</h1>\n<p>Hello and welcome to a short overview of how the development of MVC websites work in Kentico.</p>\n<p>Kentico MVC websites use two separate web applications.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The MVC application displays the live site and the Kentico application provides the administration interface.</p>\n<p>The MVC application runs on the standard ASP.NET MVC 5 framework.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Kentico serves as a content repository and provides a simple and easy to understand administration interface that empowers content editors and online marketers with a long list of functionality for editing content or running online marketing activities.</p>\n<p>The administration interface of the Kentico application is built on ASP.NET Web Forms, and can be widely customized and made to fit almost any user scenario.</p>\n<p>Both applications run on their own URLs and but they share the same database.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Website editors create and manage the content in the Kentico application which is displayed on the live site through the Kentico API.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Kentico API is integrated into the MVC application as NuGet packages and its libraries provide an extensive functionality for a large number of client scenarios.</p>\n<p>Ranging from small, single-purpose microsites for marketing campaigns over medium-size business websites with e-stores all the way up to large-scale portals with large teams of editors working on different continents and with millions of website visitors from different cultures.</p>\n<p>Any change to the live site or in the admin interface is automatically synchronized, as both applications are running in a web farm.</p>\n<p>It is the shared database and the Kentico API that allow both applications to work as a web farm and ensure that changes in one of the applications are immediately reflected in the other.</p>\n<p>The synchronization options cover various types of data, including cached database content, settings of the site or individual objects, or uploaded files.</p>\n<p>When a web editor changes the text of a page in the admin interface, the data is stored in the database.</p>\n<p>Then the Kentico application initiates a synchronization task and triggers a task for the MVC application.</p>\n<p>The MVC application runs the task and invalidates the matching data in its cache.</p>\n<p>When a website's visitor requests the content that has been updated the MVC application retrieves the updated content from the database and serves it on the live site.</p>\n<p>As editing of the content takes place in a separate application, the content which an editor updates doesn't need to be immediately promoted to the live site.</p>\n<p>It can pass through complex content workflows which help large editor teams to ensure that only approved content is displayed to the website's audience.</p>\n<p>In summary, when developers build a website in Kentico MVC solution, they prepare two applications the front-facing MVC application and the administration interface, which both share the same database.</p>"},"_playerOptions":{"features":["playpause","progress","current","duration","speed","volume","fullscreen"]},"instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"media","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true},"_isOptional":false,"_classes":"","_id":"a36a840a-e901-46e8-ae04-28cdb5734639","_parentId":"5b9b499e-2d19-4405-9d3c-4606736fede6","_type":"component","title":"Overview

Transcript","inlineTranscriptBody":"<h1>Ways to store data in Kentico</h1>\n<p>Hi there. In this video, we are going to look at ways you can use to store content in Kentico. The content editors add the content in the administration interface which stores the data in a shared database. The data is then retrieved via the Kentico API to the live site running as a separate MVC application.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, pages are only one of the approaches you can use.&nbsp;Before you start defining your website architecture,&nbsp;let's see what options Kentico provides for storing the website's data.</p>\n<p>Besides already mentioned pages, you can use module classes, custom tables, and media libraries.</p>\n<p>Pages are the most common way to store data on websites.&nbsp;Editors&nbsp;can also add files to pages as attachments. One of the benefits of storing data in pages is that you can display them in a visual hierarchy in the content tree.</p>\n<p>Seeing pages in hierarchy helps content editors, as they can quickly navigate around and easily pick the content they want to manage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Storing content in pages also allows you to configure access permissions for editors down to individual pages, and define detailed reviewing and approval processes using workflows. Lastly, you can use pages to store content in different languages and manage translations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The second option is to use custom module classes.&nbsp;Custom module classes allow you to store large amounts of content. They are extremely helpful when you need to access the stored data in the admin interface, but don't want to display it in the visual hierarchy of the content tree.</p>\n<p>For example, you can use custom module classes&nbsp;when you want to create a specialized interface within the admin UI through which the editors will add and manage data.</p>\n<p>Custom module classes also provide the best options if you need to model relationships between different types of data or integrate advanced custom functionality. So, that's custom module classes.</p>\n<p>The third option to store a large amount of data is to use custom tables. Custom tables allow you to create your custom database tables and manage their content directly from the administration interface without using any specialized database management tool. They come in handy when you need to store a large amount of data in a flat structure.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Content editors can access the data stored in custom tables from the administration interface,&nbsp;but this data will not be displayed in a visual hierarchy as pages in the content tree.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So when to use custom module classes, and when the custom tables? Well,&nbsp;it depends on the use case.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you need editors to add records&nbsp;through a custom-built user interface within Kentico, use custom module classes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And if your editors just need to add or update the data in a simple, table-like interface, use custom tables.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The last available option for storing data are media libraries. Media libraries are designed to store large files, such as images, videos or packaged files. You can also use them to store your files externally and distribute them through CDNs. You will learn about media libraries and how to work with them later in the course.</p>\n<p>These are the four options you can use to store data in Kentico.&nbsp;Analyze your project requirements and decide which option fits best your client's needs.</p>\n<p>Either you decide to use the hierarchy of pages, store large files in media libraries, extend functionality with custom module classes&nbsp;or store a flat data structure in custom tables, make certain you understand how and when you can use them. This will make sure you pick the best option for your client's needs.</p>"},"_playerOptions":{"features":["playpause","progress","current","duration","speed","volume","fullscreen"]},"instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"media","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true},"_isOptional":false,"_classes":"","_id":"17834fc6-9471-40ba-ae3e-9eb6947a09f4","_parentId":"fcf91950-497b-4de8-bb25-d43df578392c","_type":"component","title":"Ways to store data in Kentico","displayTitle":"Ways to store data in Kentico"},{"_setCompletionOn":"play","_useClosedCaptions":true,"_allowFullScreen":true,"_media":{"mp4":"https://assets-eu-01.kc-usercontent.com:443/63117da1-007f-01dd-86eb-23e8353ac375/99d3b344-ffcf-418b-b817-b41948b36fb8/mvc-editing-content-in-kentico-mvc.mp4","poster":"https://assets-eu-01.kc-usercontent.com:443/63117da1-007f-01dd-86eb-23e8353ac375/810fe2b7-367a-4754-addd-a980801e352a/mvc-editing-content-loading-page.png","cc":{"srclang":"en","src":null}},"_transcript":{"_setCompletionOnView":true,"_inlineTranscript":true,"_externalTranscript":false,"inlineTranscriptButton":"Transcript","InlineTranscriptCloseButton":"Close Transcript","inlineTranscriptBody":"<h1>Editing content in Kentico</h1>\n<p>Hello there. In this video, we'll look at two approaches editors can use to add and manage the content on Kentico MVC websites.</p>\n<p>As a developer, you need to build the website so it continues to appeal to the audience, and at the same time, provides a consistent look and predictable experience.</p>\n<p>This is can be easily achieved by strictly limiting editors so that they can work only with content without any option to influence how the content looks on the live site.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, there are situations in which you'd want to empower the editor with more control over the content and the layout of the website.</p>\n<p>The question is, how can you provide an experience to fit both? With Kentico MVC, editors can manage content in the Administration interface as highly structured content, and through the Kentico page builder.</p>\n<p>Structured content allows editors to focus only on the quality of their content. Developers prepare the structure for collecting the content. They define exactly what type of content, like headlines, body copy, images or file attachments each page will store and create the markup which displays the content in the live site application in a unified way.</p>\n<p>Structured content works best for pages with a repeated layout across the website, where the focus is on the provided information rather than on first grabbing attention and then providing information later.</p>\n<p>Typically, you will use structured content with articles, product pages or pages which don't personalize their content depending on who is viewing them, like the About page or Contact page.</p>\n<p>In some situations, content editors need to personalize the page experience to fit the audience, and that's when the Kentico page builder comes in handy.</p>\n<p>The page builder provides a user-friendly interface which allows even non-technical users to create and adjust the position of the content.</p>\n<p>A developer prepares pages which contain editable areas, as well as the components that can be added and content editors select the look they want their page to have, adjust it a bit if needed and populate it with exactly the types of content in exactly the locations on the page they have identified to achieve their goals.</p>\n<p>Typically, you will use the page builder on pages where you want to adjust the layout and content elements to fit the message, such as campaign landing pages.</p>\n<p>It's also great for pages that receive the highest amount of traffic, such as the Homepage where editors or marketers want to frequently adjust messaging to fit the company's current marketing goals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Both options have their place on MVC websites. As always, define your website architecture so that it best meets your client needs.</p>"},"_playerOptions":{"features":["playpause","progress","current","duration","speed","volume","fullscreen"]},"instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"media","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true},"_isOptional":false,"_classes":"","_id":"d36d0a0d-97ba-45d0-8a74-ef93f6d67fdc","_parentId":"6cc0bfda-9601-46d3-a402-e1c9a4ab48d0","_type":"component","title":"Editing content in Kentico MVC","displayTitle":"Editing content in Kentico MVC"},{"body":"<p><strong>Kentico Installer</strong>&nbsp;performs a number of operations.

Keep in mind that the approach we took with the Medio Clinic is one of many, and most of the functionality may be implemented in a different way.

This abstraction is useful for multiple reasons, such as better support for automated testing and dependency injection. It also limits the number of locations that directly call the Kentico API and makes it easier to deal with changes in the API when upgrading to newer versions.</li>\n  <li>The <a href=\"https://autofaccn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/integration/mvc.html?highlight=resolver\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Autofac dependency injection container</a> is used to instantiate services, repositories and other interface implementations (both for the custom-built classes and ones from the Kentico API).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>MedioClinic project</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Standard MVC web application project structure: controllers, models, views, configuration files, startup logic, etc.</li>\n  <li>Contains all front-end design files and content items required for the website (stylesheets, scripts, images, resource files).</li>\n  <li>Integration with the Kentico API is provided by the installed <strong>Kentico.AspNet.Mvc</strong> NuGet package.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Business project</h3>\n<p>Enterprise-level applications usually require separation of business logic from the web application code.

The Dto classes represent Kentico pages and objects, but carry only the minimum required data.

For example, instead of directly calling the Kentico API to localize resource strings, you call the custom <em>Localize</em> method within views. If the Kentico API changes in future versions, you just need to update your custom <em>Localize</em> method, not all occurrences of code that localize resource strings.</li>\n  <li>The <strong>DI</strong>&nbsp;folder contains classes that register services into the Autofac dependency injection container (these are used in the startup logic of the MVC web application).

Page types serve as structures for storing content in Kentico.</p>\n<p>When developers identify what type of content the website editors intend to create,&nbsp;they need to figure out the structure of individual pages that will hold this content.</p>\n<p>You already know that editors can edit pages on the website as structured content or use the Kentico page builder. You also know that the&nbsp;data is stored in the database, and then displayed on the live site via the Kentico API.</p>\n<p>The page data needs to be stored in a way that allows developers to create flexible logic for retrieving and displaying content.</p>\n<p>And page types are here to help with that.</p>\n<p>With the MVC development model, every page is based on a content-only page type.</p>\n<p>Each page type consists of fields, which define the content structure for pages of the given type, as well as the columns of the underlying database table.</p>\n<p>The editing interface through which editors input data in Kentico is provided by form controls, which can be assigned to individual fields.</p>\n<p>A form control displays a certain element, such as a text box or area, a drop-down-selector, or a group of radio buttons.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Regardless of the input element's type, each form control saves its value into a single field in the database.</p>\n<p>Fields can also have additional settings, such as tooltips for the editing interface, or conditions under which the field will be visible to specific users.</p>\n<p>For pages with structured content, the fields automatically define a simple editing interface.</p>\n<p>The field editing interface allows editors to focus on optimizing the content, and leave worries about the final live site appearance of pages to the developers.</p>\n<p>If developers decide to give editors more control over both the content and design of a page through the page builder, they need to define editable areas on the page, as well as the MVC widgets the editors will use.</p>\n<p>Even though the visual experience of the page builder is different from structured content editing via form controls, pages that use the page builder still need to be based on a page type.</p>\n<p>As content-only pages just store data, they don't need to be organized in any special hierarchy. However, a content tree without any visual hierarchy or structure can soon become highly confusing.</p>\n<p>It's the developers who can help and define page types in a way that makes creating new pages easier and more intuitive.</p>\n<p>How? They can either set lists of allowed child and parent page types, or create page type scopes. While the allowed child and parent types define limits for individual page types, the scopes narrow down the number of page types that editors can create under specified paths within the content tree.</p>\n<p>With either of these boundaries, keep in mind that the hierarchy of the content tree will be just a visual representation for editors, because content-only pages do not define actual pages on the live site.</p>\n<p>Content-only page types don't have a presentation URL by default.</p>\n<p>This means that the Kentico application&nbsp;does not automatically know the live URLs under which individual pages will be available.</p>\n<p>If you want editors to create hyperlinks or preview the live site appearance of pages in the administration interface, you need to specify a URL pattern for each page type.</p>\n<p>The URL pattern determines the addresses under which the administration interface accesses the pages.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When an editor creates a page and adds content to its fields, the data is stored in three interconnected database tables.</p>\n<p>CMS_Tree stores information about the page's position in the content tree.</p>\n<p>CMS_Document holds the page's properties, metadata, and content defined by editors through the page builder.</p>\n<p>A third table, referred to as a \"coupled data\" table, holds the page's structured content. Each page type has its own table, with columns that match the page type's fields.</p>\n<p>For websites with multilingual content, say English and Spanish, the CMS_Tree table always contains one record per page, while CMS_Document and the coupled data table store a separate record for each culture variant of a page.</p>\n<p>That's how page types work in Kentico. As a developer, you create the page types that store data in the database and provide editors with means to input data through form controls.</p>\n<p>And by defining the URL pattern for page types, you allow editors to work with pages correctly in the admin interface.</p>"},"_playerOptions":{"features":["playpause","progress","current","duration","speed","volume","fullscreen"]},"instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"media","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true},"_isOptional":false,"_classes":"","_id":"1e655b34-22aa-4d6f-9dd1-2cea927840e3","_parentId":"a20c7735-97e2-465c-8eb3-cf8ac2127c0f","_type":"component","title":"Video: How page types work","displayTitle":"Video: How page types work"},{"body":"<p>By default, the system does not know the URL under which content-only pages are presented, so content editors cannot access the pages in the <strong>Preview</strong> mode within the administration interface. They also cannot use features that rely on the preview mode, such as the page builder, or create hyperlinks to pages in the content tree using the built-in text editor. To enable editors to fully leverage the power of the Kentico MVC development model, you need to specify a <strong>URL pattern</strong> for your page types.</p>\n<h3>The URL pattern</h3>\n<p>The <strong>URL pattern</strong> specifies how the system resolves the page's URL within the administration interface. The system combines the URL pattern with the site's presentation URL and creates the overall display URL of the page.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The URL pattern comes in especially&nbsp;handy for pages which are presented separately on the live site. On the other hand, you don't need to set a URL pattern for pages &nbsp;in the content tree that do not represent distinct pages on the live site. In some cases, you may have pages whose content is aggregated in a different page, which then presents a complete page on the live site. For example, you can show all company offices listed on one page on the live site, but store information about each office in a separate page in the content tree. If you don't need to display individual offices on separate pages, you don't need to set a URL pattern for the 'office' page type, but only for the listing 'offices' type.</p>\n<h3>Macros in URL patterns</h3>\n<p>By adding macro expressions representing page properties into the URL pattern, you can set presentation URLs for separate pages based on the same page type, or different language versions of the same page. Using macro variables in your patterns is particularly important on larger sites with multiple cultures.</p>\n<p>Kentico macro expressions use the object-oriented <strong>K# </strong>language, which is very similar to the C# programming language. The system identifies string as a macros when you enclose the expression into curly brackets with a percentage sign: <em>{% MacroExpression %}</em>. To learn more about the K# language, other parameters you can use, and creating advanced macro expressions, visit our <a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/macro-expressions/macro-syntax\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>To find out what node and page data is available for your URL pattern macro expressions, you can look into the built-in Kentico macro console. Navigate to the <strong>System </strong>application, select the <strong>Macros </strong>&gt; <strong>Console </strong>tab and type, e.g., <em>CurrentDocument.</em> into the console. The macro autocomplete feature will list all the properties that are available in the page and node data.</p>\n<p>The most common way to address a page on MVC sites is to use the {% <em>NodeAlias %}</em> macro, which retrieves the page alias and helps to create more SEO-friendly URLs.</p>\n<p>Besides the pages aliases, you can also add the {% <em>DocumentCulture %}</em> macro to the URL pattern, which resolves into the culture code of the page's currently active content culture.</p>\n<p>For example, when a page type for blog articles has the following URL pattern:</p>\n<p><em>{% DocumentCulture %}/Articles/{% NodeAlias %}</em></p>\n<p>An article, e.g., '<em>The Magical Health Benefits of Being Cold</em>' in the Medio Clinic website's US English culture, has the following live URL:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>http://medioclinic.com/en-US/Articles/The-Magical-Health-Benefits-of-Being-Cold</em></p>\n<p>where '<em>en-US</em>' is the culture code and '<em>The-Magical-Health-Benefits-of-Being-Cold</em>' is the article's page alias.</p>\n<div class=\"infobox note\"><p>We do not recommend using query string parameters in URL patterns. When the system generates the <em>Preview</em> <em>URLs</em> for pages based on the specified pattern, it removes any parameters.</p></div>\n<p>Macro expressions in the URL pattern help you create more robust system logic, which is ready to serve when you need to start scaling up your application.&nbsp;</p>","instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"textWithCode","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true},"_isOptional":false,"_classes":"","_id":"c6509777-b455-4f56-83db-cbd333015b07","_parentId":"51a2c7c1-bb28-4085-ad2e-b697e9091e5f","_type":"component","title":"Theory: URL Pattern","displayTitle":"URL pattern"},{"body":"<p>Kentico provides options to website editors who want to attach files to pages in the content tree.

It provides a rich feature set and makes it easy to manage and serve content in different languages (cultures), both in the administration interface and on the live site. Kentico supports several approaches to localization, from long structured content stored as pages, to short, individual strings which for example serve as captions or title elements displayed in the footer of your website.</p>\n<h2>Localizing content of pages</h2>\n<p>Before website editors can start localizing content, developers or administrators need to assign the required cultures to the site (this can be done in the <strong>Sites</strong> application). By default, the system contains all commonly used cultures, but you can extend the list in the <strong>Localization</strong> application on the <strong>Cultures</strong> tab if necessary. These cultures do not automatically provide any actual translations of text, they only determine which language/culture options are available for the website.</p>\n<p>Multilingual content of pages can be managed in the <strong>Pages</strong> application. A site with multiple cultures stores different language variants of content in separate versions of pages in the content tree. The website editors can translate content themselves, or they can use connectors to translation services and assign translation tasks to get the content in the languages they need.</p>\n<h3>Available translation services</h3>\n<p>The integrated translation services take content prepared in one language and create its variant in another language. To create the multilingual website, the \"translators\" don't need to edit the text in the Kentico administration interface. Kentico automatically ensures data transfer between the website pages and translation providers in the standardized XLIFF format.</p>\n<p>Machine services programmatically convert source text from one language to another (by default, Kentico provides services for <strong>Microsoft Translator</strong> and <strong>Google Translate</strong>). You can also connect your website to human translation services, such as the default <strong>Translations.com</strong> service. However, you are not limited to these three services. Kentico is a highly-customizable solution, and you can develop <a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/custom-development/miscellaneous-custom-development-tasks/developing-custom-translation-services\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">custom translation services</a>.</p>\n<p>The system also provides manual translation services that allow editors to <strong>send content for translation via email</strong>, or <strong>export the translation data</strong> to the file system. In both cases, the export package contains <em>.xlf</em>&nbsp;files.&nbsp;Once the content is translated, the packages need to be imported back to the system manually.</p>\n<p>Find out more about how <a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/multilingual-websites/configuring-translation-services/human-translation-services-email-translation\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">email</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/multilingual-websites/configuring-translation-services/human-translation-services-manual-translation\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">manual</a> translation services work or how you can <a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/multilingual-websites/configuring-translation-services\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">configure the translation services</a> in our documentation.</p>\n<h2>Editing multicultural content in the Pages application</h2>\n<p>With a correctly set <strong>URL pattern</strong> for page types, website editors can preview the default and other culture versions of pages in the content tree. Depending on the culture they are editing, website editors can also assign different workflows and submit different culture variants of the pages to culture-specific approval processes.</p>\n<div class=\"infobox note\"><p>In the training website for this course, we use the <em>{%DocumentCulture%}</em> macro in page type URL patterns. This macro resolves into the culture code of the language selected in the Pages application, which ensures that the URL contains a culture prefix and the correct language variant is displayed in the preview.</p></div>\n<h2>Localizing individual strings on the website</h2>\n<p>Not all content on the website needs to be stored in the <strong>Pages </strong>application. Reusable pieces of text, like contact details, captions, titles, or other individual strings on the live site don't need to be added or edited in the website's content tree.</p>\n<p>With the Kentico MVC development model, you can use the standard .NET approach and localize individual pieces of text using resource strings, stored in either <em>.resx</em> files or the database.</p>\n<div class=\"infobox note\"><p>If you are not familiar with the .NET concept of <strong>string resources</strong>, they are simple <em>key/value pairs</em> of string data. Each key can have a different value for a specific culture.</p>\n<p>With Kentico you can add the string keys into your website's content, either by using special expression within text, or by calling the appropriate API in code. The strings then resolve into the correct value based on the relevant culture context.</p></div>\n<h3>Working with resource strings</h3>\n<p>Storing resource strings within resource files has a considerable disadvantage: if you - or even the website editors - want to change anything on a running production site, you need to update the related strings in the files, and then redeploy the website.</p>\n<p>Kentico provides you with a great option - editors can manage resource strings directly in the administration interface. Editors with special permissions (<strong>Localize strings </strong>permission for the <strong>Localization</strong> module) can create the strings in the <strong>Localization </strong>application on the <strong>Resource strings</strong> tab. Kentico stores strings added through the administration interface in the website's database (in the <em>CMS_ResourceString</em> and <em>CMS_ResourceTranslation</em> tables).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can combine both approaches and the system loads resource strings from all available sources (by default, strings in the database have priority over strings in resource files).</p>\n<p>Find out more about working with resource strings in the Kentico <a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/multilingual-websites/setting-up-a-multilingual-user-interface/working-with-resource-strings\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<h2>Localizing the administration interface</h2>\n<p>Kentico also provides the option to localize the administration interface, so that users feel at home when working with their website. Users can set the culture of the admin UI in their profiles. The interface culture determines not only the language of text in the interface, but also other factors like numeric and date formats.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>By default, the Kentico installation only provides an English (\"en-us\" culture) pack for the user interface texts. However, you can obtain packs for other languages from the Kentico community, or prepare your own translations of the used resource files.</p>\n<p>Kentico allows for managing content in any language, including double-byte (eastern) languages, such as Chinese. All content is stored and published in UNICODE.</p>\n<p>Find out more about setting up a multicultural UI in our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/multilingual-websites/setting-up-a-multilingual-user-interface\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<h2>Serving multicultural content on the live site</h2>\n<p>Adding culture-specific routes, setting the current culture context, and retrieving multicultural page content through the Kentico API will be covered later in the course. So let's just get a basic overview to complete the picture of how Kentico MVC websites handle multicultural content.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The MVC development model allows creating of URLs with culture prefixes, which can help your website with SEO.</li>\n  <li>You can develop functionality that allows site visitors to manually switch between languages.</li>\n  <li>You need to ensure that you load the correct culture versions of pages when retrieving content in your website's code.</li>\n</ul>","instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"textWithCode","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true},"_isOptional":false,"_classes":"","_id":"fbe8ccba-374c-4e9f-8b62-3ab667e4e3a6","_parentId":"99c87c4a-fca6-4690-9792-bd2014da7713","_type":"component","title":"Multicultural sites","displayTitle":"Multicultural sites"},{"body":"<h2>1.

You can also let the ASP.NET framework detect the culture and locale automatically based on the environment of the user's client.</p>\n<p>For websites built using the Kentico MVC development model, we recommend determining the culture using a language prefix in the URLs of incoming requests.</p>\n<p>As a refresher, the ASP.NET framework keeps track of two culture-related values - the <em>Culture</em> and <em>UICulture</em> - which determine things like date formats or currency symbols. The cultures are applied to the current request's active thread and remain active for its lifetime.</p>\n<p>With this information in mind, you can implement functionality which detects and sets the culture properties according to a route parameter.</p>\n<p>Let's review what needs to be covered. First, your solution needs to find the request's culture through a parameter defined in your route templates. Then, you need to use the value to configure the current thread's <em>CurrentCulture</em> property (using an object of the .NET <em>System.Globalization.CultureInfo</em> type).</p>\n<p>The Kentico localization API then automatically works with the given culture, for example when resolving resource strings. You also need to use the culture value to load the correct language version of pages in code that retrieves your website's content (this topic will be covered later in the course).</p>\n<p>Here is a sample implementation from the Dancing Goat sample site. The following is a custom route handler class, which can then be assigned to individual routes in the <em>RouteConfig</em>.</p>\n[Inline content item resolver provided an invalid HTML 5 fragment (10:47).

To ensure that only valid URLs match your routes, you can set up some constraints and specify which types of URL parameters are valid. Let's take a look at some of the most common types of route constraints you might want to use on your Kentico MVC website.</p>\n<h2>Culture constraint</h2>\n<p>Your website will likely support only a limited number of cultures, and your route templates should reflect that. There are a number of possible approaches you can take when defining your site's routing.</p>\n<p>For example, the Kentico API provides you with the <a href=\"http://devnet.kentico.com/docs/11_0/api/html/T_CMS_SiteProvider_CultureSiteInfoProvider.htm\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CultureSiteInfoProvider</a> class (in the <em>CMS.SiteProvider</em> namespace), and you can call its <em>GetSiteCultures()</em> method to load the cultures assigned to the site in Kentico. This allows you to create a constraint that compares the retrieved culture codes with the culture parameter in the route. In cases where the URL does not match the constraint's requirements, you can fall back to a default culture or return a 404 response. To see an example of a culture constraint, view the code of the MedioClinic's <a href=\"https://github.com/Kentico/training-kentico-k12/blob/master/MedioClinic/Utils/SiteCultureConstraint.cs\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>SiteCultureConstraint</em></a> class.</p>\n<h2>Constraints on editor inputs</h2>\n<p>For some types of pages, you may want to give website editors control over a part of the URL. This gives them the option to create human-readable keywords in the URL.</p>\n<p>If you use the default Kentico page alias (<em>NodeAlias</em> field) for this purpose, the administration interface automatically ensures that the value is a valid URL string (without spaces or unsafe characters like ? or #).</p>\n<p>However, if you directly add custom fields into your URL patterns, you may wish to use route constraints to limit which types of inputs are valid. For example, you can use the .NET <em>AlphaRouteConstraint</em> class to allow only letter characters.</p>\n<h2>Constraint on the {nodeGuid} parameter</h2>\n<p>Using the page alias in your route templates introduces a possible challenge. Internally, the page alias is stored in the <em>NodeAlias</em> column of each page, and you can supply it into your URL patterns through the <em>{%NodeAlias%}</em> macro.</p>\n<div class=\"infobox note\"><p>Kentico only ensures that page aliases are unique within a given level of the website's content tree (under the same parent page).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For example, pages stored directly in the&nbsp;<em>/Doctors</em>&nbsp;section will always have a unique page alias among each other. However, if one page is stored under&nbsp;<em>/Doctors/Surgeons</em>&nbsp;and another page under&nbsp;<em>/Doctors/Dentists</em>, they can both have the same page alias.</p></div>\n<p>When you give editors control over the page alias, it's possible that two or more pages could be created with the same page alias in different sections of the website. If you only use the <em>NodeAlias</em> to identify pages in your URLs and code, your website could behave incorrectly.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We recommend that you use route templates that combine the unique <em>NodeGuid</em> value together with the page alias, for example <em>\"{culture}/Doctors/{nodeGuid}/{pageAlias}\"</em>. The Guid provides a unique identifier for the page, while the page alias adds the human-readable part of the URL.</p>\n<p>When you include the {nodeGuid} parameter in a route template, it can be useful to define a constraint. For example, you can use the .NET <em>GuidRouteConstraint</em> class to constrain the parameter to allow only values of the <em>System.Guid</em> type. You can see an example in the <a href=\"https://github.com/Kentico/training-kentico-k12/blob/master/MedioClinic/App_Start/RouteConfig.cs\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>implementation of the constraint</em></a> on the Medio Clinic site for pages that display doctor profiles.</p>\n<p>These three types of constraints don't exhaust all the possibilities you'd want to define on your MVC website. They are here just to give you an idea of what you should consider when defining the behavior of your website's routes.</p>","instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"textWithCode","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true},"_isOptional":false,"_classes":"","_id":"4fcff2ce-b88e-4ca6-9361-79eccf5c933a","_parentId":"e1af5624-704d-4a18-99ff-c3f83d2e71c9","_type":"component","title":"Setting up URL constraints","displayTitle":"Setting up URL constraints"},{"body":"<p>The following text highlights in short how the Medio Clinic project implements URLs and handles multicultural content.

Instead of calling Kentico API directly in your MVC code, e.g., in controllers, you may want to introduce an additional layer of logic and separate your application's code from the Kentico API entirely.</p>\n<p>Separating the website's code from Kentico API brings additional benefits. For example, having custom services that are responsible for communicating with Kentico API, allows your website to use those services instead of directly using Kentico API. Your custom services can extend the available methods and call for data which the generated providers don't present, such as, the<em>&nbsp;page title</em>&nbsp;and other&nbsp;<em>page metadata</em>&nbsp;type of information.

We We recommend not instantiating services manually, rather you should rely on the DI to do that for you.</p>\n<h2>Dependency injection design pattern</h2>\n<p>The dependency injection design pattern is a common pattern to many programming languages. &nbsp;Instead of instantiating a service instance manually, you can pass the service instance into the constructor as a parameter, and its instantiating is handled by the DI. &nbsp;If you are not familiar with the dependency injection design pattern in general, you can start with the following articles:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dependency Injection</a> by Steve Smith</li>\n  <li><a href=\"http:// http://www.mikesdotnetting.com/article/117/dependency-injection-and-inversion-of-control-with-asp-net-mvc\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control with ASP.NET MVC</a> by Mike Brind</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using dependency injection in the development of MVC application brings many benefits.

It is also easier to create tests for your MVC controllers because you can test them in isolation from dependent classes.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Using dependency injection containers</h2>\n<p>We recommend that you instantiate your custom and Kentico services using a dependency injection container.

The latest version of the page is stored in the <em>CMS_VersionHistory</em> table and can be retrieved by calling <em>.LatestVersion()</em> method in Kentico API.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Editors can preview their changes on the <strong>Page</strong> tab in the administration interface, e.g., when using workflows. (Developers need to enable the <em>Page</em> tab when they create the page type for the page.) If editors navigate to the&nbsp;<strong>Page</strong>&nbsp;tab, Kentico displays the page from the live site's MVC application in an&nbsp;<em>&lt;iframe&gt;</em>&nbsp;HTML element inside the administration interface.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The preview functionality is not limited only to the administration interface. If editors need to share an unpublished page with, e.g., external contractors who don't have access to the admin interface, they can generate a <strong>Preview URL</strong> of the page on the <strong>General</strong> tab. (Find out more about <a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/managing-website-content/working-with-pages/sending-links-to-unpublished-pages\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sending links to unpublished pages</a> in Kentico documentation.)</p>\n<h2>How does the preview work?</h2>\n<p>The <em>preview URLs</em> that Kentico generates for pages consist of parameters defined in the <em>URL pattern</em> as well as additional information, such as language version and a hash for validating the URLs.</p>\n<p>The Kentico integration package in the MVC application validates and processes the preview URL. It removes the additional information and leaves the original presentation URL based on the URL pattern. The original presentation URL goes through the standard routing process.</p>\n<p>Some additional info about the preview:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The preview has to be enabled by calling <em>UsePreview()</em> method in the <em>ApplicationBuilder</em> instance in the <em>App_Start.</em></li>\n  <li>Generated preview links can be too long. You might want to set the <em>maxUrlLength</em> attribute of the <em>httpRuntime</em> to, e.g., 515 characters, in the MVC project's <em>web.config</em>.</li>\n  <li>Data caching needs to be disabled for the preview mode.</li>\n  <li><em>OutputCache</em> attributes on controllers are not used in the preview mode. (It is automatically ensured by the Kentico integration packages in the MVC application.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How is the preview mode protected against CSRF attacks?</h3>\n<p>If your MVC application is protected against the CSRF attacks using the <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.mvc.validateantiforgerytokenattribute%28v=vs.118%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ValidateAntiForgeryToken</a> attribute, the application automatically sends a header that enables the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">same-origin policy</a>. The <em>UsePreview</em> feature disables the policy for the preview URLs which allows editors to preview the unpublished content displayed in the MVC application. The preview mode works even if the live site is running on a different domain than the Kentico administration interface.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you decide to protect your website users against <em>clickjacking, </em>you can manually enable the same-origin policy by specifying the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">X-Frame-Options HTTP response header</a> in the MVC application's <em>web.config </em>file. As a result, the browsers won't be able to render pages in the <em>&lt;iframe&gt;</em> element. If editors decide to use the preview mode and other related features, e.g., the page builder, they will see a blank page instead of the previewed content in the administration interface. However, they will still be able to preview the pages on the live site using the generated <em>Preview URL</em>.

A workflow is <strong>a sequence of steps</strong> which details the life cycle of pages. Workflows help define <strong>review and approval processes</strong> which editors use to ensure that only a high-quality content gets published on the live site.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In Kentico, you can <strong>specify roles</strong> that different users have, and <strong>the points</strong> within the content-only page life cycle, e.g., <em>Draft</em>, <em>Review</em>, <em>Ready for publishing</em>,<em> Published</em>, when only the specified people can work with pages. To make sure only one editor works on a page at one time, you might want to combine workflows with <a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/configuring-kentico/configuring-the-environment-for-content-editors/configuring-and-using-page-versioning/content-locking\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">content locking</a>. The workflow functionality also provides editors options to comment on approving or rejecting the changes to the page's content.</p>\n<p>An example of a simple workflow process is approving changes to a new article. A copywriter creates the article introducing a change in legal terms to website visitors and sends it for approval to an editor. The editor corrects the text and sends it to the legal department for approval. Once approved, the page moves to a content manager, who publishes the page to the live site.</p>\n<h2>The default workflow</h2>\n<p>Kentico comes with <em>a default workflow</em> which consists of three steps - <em>Edit</em>, <em>Published</em>, and <em>Archived</em>.</p>\n<p>Pages in the <em>edit</em> step are available only to the specified people in the admin UI (or via generated preview links). Pages in the <em>published </em>step are displayed on the live site. And by default, pages in the <em>archive</em>d step stay in the content tree, but they aren't displayed on the live site.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Types of workflows in Kentico</h2>\n<p>Kentico offers you two types of workflows - basic workflows and advanced workflows.</p>\n<p>The<strong> basic workflows</strong> consist of a flow of successive steps, where the page moves from one step to another in a direct sequence. The <strong>advanced workflows</strong> feature (available in the EMS edition of Kentico) allows you to create additional logic between the workflow steps and introduce branching by defining <em>conditions</em>, <em>waiting periods</em>, or <em>user decisions</em> before the page moves to the following steps.</p>\n<p>This course covers only working with basic workflows, however, feel free to find out more information about <a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/configuring-kentico/configuring-the-environment-for-content-editors/configuring-workflows/designing-advanced-workflows\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">designing the advanced workflows</a> in our documentation.</p>\n<h2>Applying workflows</h2>\n<p>You can apply a workflow on pages on your site using one of the two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Apply a workflow directly on a page</strong>, or a page and its children directly from the Pages application. Applying a workflow directly also creates a workflow scope.</li>\n  <li><strong>Create a workflow scope</strong> when you need to have more control when applying a workflow on the pages on your site. You can exclude pages from a workflow and control to which page types and cultures the scope applies. Each scope can also have conditions based on which it will be applied to pages.

You should always consider the specific requirements of the project. Also, your approach should reflect how much control over the website's navigation you want to give to editors.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>1) Hard-coded navigation</h2>\n<p>For simple MVC sites, you can hard code the navigation. The result of this approach is a static menu which gives website editors no control over the items that the menu displays or links to. Building such a static menu is fast, the initial cost is inexpensive, and you work only within the MVC application. However, any changes to the menu the client needs require developer's assistance.</p>\n<p>You can see an example of hard-coded navigation in Kentico Dancing Goat MVC sample site (NEEDS UPDATE https://github.com/Kentico/Mvc). It generates the link using the <em>ActionLink</em> helper method, supplies the link text from the <em>.resx</em> file via <em>GetString()</em> method in Kentico <em>ResHelper</em> class and calls specific controller actions of the pages in the menu.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\"><!-- DANCING GOAT NAVIGATION -->\n(...)\n                            <li>\n                                @Html.ActionLink(ResHelper.GetString(\"DancingGoatMvc.Home\"), \"Index\", \"Home\")\n                            </li>\n(...)</code></pre>\n<h2>2) Navigation defined by editors</h2>\n<p>When editors of a simple website need more control over the items in the navigation menu, you can take an opposite approach and give editors full control over which items appear in the navigation menu.</p>\n<p>The items in the content tree don't need to represent the actual structure of pages on the live site, but a means to collect data. &nbsp;You can prepare a specific page type which editors can use to create items for navigation in the content tree. This page type can collect the menu item captions and pages which editors want to put into the navigation in the content tree and allow them to define an order of these items within the website navigation.</p>\n<p>To prevent inconsistencies or incorrect behavior of the menu, you need to draft detailed specifications in the very beginning of the project to plan the website architecture design accordingly. As a result, website editors will have full control over the items that appear in the menu - provided they follow the rules you set for the menu items (and your implementation contains adequate safety-checks - just in case editors deviate from your instructions).</p>\n<p>For example, you can use the <em>UNI selector</em> form control in your page type and filter only specific pages, page types or documents under specific paths which are allowed for the menu. Without setting the right restrictions, it may happen that editors select for the menu &nbsp;items in the content tree that not supported, and the system will not generate correct data for the&nbsp;website's menu. Therefore we recommend that you investigate the project requirements closely before you consider developing this functionality.</p>\n<p>To see a concrete implementation, you can investigate how menu is implemented in Kentico MVC tutorial. The very simple tutorial website makes use of the&nbsp;<em>RelativeUrl</em>&nbsp;property of the content-tree item. Your code first loads the&nbsp;<em>NodeGUID</em>&nbsp;identifier of all objects editors have specified as menu items (using the&nbsp;<em>Page selector</em>&nbsp;form control) and returns the URL for the page whose GUID matches the given menu item's selected page. The following snippet overviews how the menu is implemented , for details, see the <a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12tutorial/mvc-development\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kentico 12 Tutorial</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>3) Navigation defined by technically savvy editor or admin</h2>\n<p>The third option somewhat meets both approaches mentioned above in the middle.</p>\n<p>It still provides editors control over items which appear in the navigation menu within the content tree. On the other, editors who define the menu need to understand the technical background of the MVC implementation to add menu items without creating undesired behavior.<br>\nThe implementation includes specific page type for menu items which collects values of controllers and actions that are called by individual items on the live site. Controllers/Actions are passed to the MedioClinic live site where views generate link URLs using standard ASP.NET MVC methods.</p>\n<h3>Medio Clinic implementation</h3>\n<p>The Medio clinic project takes this approach to website navigation. It collects values for the menu in the content tree into pages created from the <em>MenuContainerItem</em> page type. Their values are retrieved using <em>DocumentQuery</em> service and mapped to <em>MenuItemDtos</em>. The navigation is shared in all individual controllers, so it is implemented in the BaseController which every other controller inherits.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<em>BaseController</em> includes a collection of menu items in <em>PageViewModel</em> which is then resolved and passed to views for individual pages. You can see the detailed implementation of the navigation menu in the <em>Demo</em> section below.</p>\n<p>To sum it up, these three approaches are not supposed to describe all the available options.

They can store all types of files editors might want to work with, images, videos or non-image files, such as documents. Here is a basic overview of the behavior of media files:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The physical files are uploaded to the project's file system, or you can use any external storage provider, such as Azure Blob Storage or Amazon S3. However, if you decide to use the external storage provider, you need to implement it in your code and configure &nbsp;the admin interface.</li>\n  <li>Website editors can organize media files into a hierarchy of folders to group related files.&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>The physical files are not uploaded to the database, only a link to the file is added to the database (unlike the page attachments where you <a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/configuring-kentico/managing-files/storing-files\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">can decide on where files are stored</a>).&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>By default, both media library files and their folders are synchronized between the admin UI and the MVC application automatically as the web farm mode is enabled in the MVC development model.</li>\n</ul>","title":"Media library basics","_graphic":null},{"body":"<p>The physical files are stored in the file system and synced with the MVC application thanks to the web farm synchronization. The editors can upload files to the media libraries from the admin UI or they can access the file system directly and upload files via, e.g., FTP.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Storing media library files</h2>\n<p>The physical files in the file system are stored in the folder hierarchy that mirrors the folder hierarchy of the media library in the UI. To make navigation around the folder structure in the <em>Media libraries</em> application easier, developers can configure the number of folders which can be displayed under an expanded folder node in the media libraries tree view.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Editors can store an unlimited number of files in the media library. However, we don't recommend storing more than 100 files per library if you want to use external storage option, such as Azure Blob Storage, as the number of files per library affects the performance of the <em>Media library </em>application's UI.&nbsp;If you plan to store the physical files only in the file system, you can store any number of files within one media library.</p>\n<h3>Configuring storage options</h3>\n<p>You can configure the locations of the folder where the system stores media files in the Settings application. If the value is empty, the system stores the files in the default location <em>~/&lt;sitecodename&gt;/media/&lt;MediaLibraryFolderName&gt;</em>.</p>\n<p>In case you run several MVC applications using one administration interface which means the files from different sites are stored in different folder structures.</p>\n<p>If you need to change the location of the media libraries file, you can specify the <em>physical path</em>,<em> root-relative path</em> or <em>UNC path</em> to store the libraries on different servers. Find out more about <a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k9/managing-website-content/configuring-the-environment-for-content-editors/configuring-media-libraries#Configuringmedialibraries-Configuringcustomstorageformedialibraries\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">configuring custom storage</a> in Kentico documentation.</p>\n<h3>Using external storage</h3>\n<p>The media library files can be stored in the file system or in an external storage provider.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You need to decide early in the project where the files will be stored, because it's not possible to migrate the files from, for example, the file system to Azure CDN. If you tried to migrate the files, all URLs become invalid and even the structure of the media library folders may be affected.</p>\n<p>If you want to store media libraries in a cloud-based file system, you need to configure your MVC application to use storage-specific providers. Configuration of the MVC application for external storage follows the same instruction as for Kentico projects.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>For Azure Blob storage, see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/custom-development/working-with-physical-files-using-the-api/configuring-file-system-providers/configuring-azure-storage#ConfiguringAzurestorage-ConfiguringKenticotostoreonlymediafilesonAzurestorage\">Configuring Azure storage</a>.</li>\n  <li>For Azure CDN, see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/deploying-websites/running-kentico-on-microsoft-azure/configuring-azure-cdn\">Configuring Azure CDN</a>.</li>\n  <li>For Amazon S3, see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/custom-development/working-with-physical-files-using-the-api/configuring-file-system-providers/configuring-amazon-s3\">Configuring Amazon S3</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When storing files in an external provider, keep in mind that Kentico is case&nbsp;<em>insensitive</em>, while the external storage applications, such as&nbsp;<em>Azure Blob Storage</em>, are case&nbsp;<em>sensitive</em>.</p>\n<h2>Registering media files in the database</h2>\n<p>Files uploaded to the media library need to be registered in the database. Files that were uploaded in the admin UI get registered automatically. Files uploaded directly to the file system outside of the admin UI need to be registered either manually from the UI (unregistered files are marked by a yellow triangle icon), or you can customize the system, for example, by developing a custom scheduled task and register the files using Kentico API.</p>\n<p>When the file is registered in the database, it's not uploaded in the database. Each media library file gets an entry in the <em>Media_Files</em> database table which collects a link to the file (<em>FileGUID column</em>), the library the file is stored in (<em>FileLibraryID</em>) and other values.</p>","title":"Storing media files","_graphic":null},{"body":"<p>Media libraries can store <strong>any types of file</strong>, such as images, sound files, videos, package files, presentations or document files. By default, there are some restrictions on what types editors can upload to media library through UI, but it's possible to configure the allowed extensions and support uploading many more different file-types in the Settings application.</p>\n<h2>Supported file types in Media libraries</h2>\n<p>Editors can preview images of different types, such as <em>bmp,&nbsp;gif,&nbsp;png,&nbsp;jpg,&nbsp;</em>or <em>jpeg, </em>directly<em> </em>in the Media library application<em>. </em>The system also detects audio and video files based on their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type\">MIME type</a>&nbsp;(audio types starting with the&nbsp;<em>audio/</em>&nbsp;prefix, video types with the&nbsp;<em>video/</em>&nbsp;prefix) and renders appropriate HTML5 markup. In the end, the types of files that can be previewed or played on your site depend on the users web browser.</p>\n<p>Editors can store other file types, such as PDF or packages. The system recognizes these file types as documents which means they cannot be played or displayed as the images or video files. However, users can download them from the live site or preview provided that their browsers contain the necessary extensions.</p>\n<h3>Adding custom files types to media libraries</h3>\n<p>You can allow custom files types, such as <em>.svg</em>, by modifying the site's <em>web.config</em> file. If your browser supports previewing, e.g., <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#search=svg\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the .svg file type</a>, the system can recognize and process. Using the <em>web.config</em> keys, you can specify which file types are detected automatically; other image file types are recognized as <em>documents</em>.</p>\nThis inline content item was not resolved because it was not retrieved from Delivery API.\n<h2>Adjusting the maximum file upload size</h2>\n<p>The default maximum upload size for IIS 7 and higher is 30 MB.

However, there is not much you can do with the returned file other than display it.</p>\n<h3>GetPermanentUrl</h3>\n<p><em>GetPermanentUrl</em> method returns file's <em>permanent URL</em>, for example, <em>~/getmedia/0140bccc-9d47-41ea-94a9-ca5d35b2964c/emergency_services.jpg. </em>If you store the media files in external storage, always generate the permanent URL of the media file.</p>\n<p>The <strong>permanent URL</strong> offers you some additional features which you can use when working with the file. You can use the permanent URL to <em>set access permissions</em> for viewing or updating the file. The permanent URLs allows you to <em>resize the images</em> in views (based on constraints) using the <em>ImageUrl</em> extension method or <em>add URL extensions</em>. On the other hand, adding more logic to retrieving the files means that performance-wise, the <em>permanent URL</em> is slower than the <em>direct URL</em>.</p>\n<h2>Displaying media files</h2>\n<p>Both methods mentioned above return files' <em>relative URLs </em>which means you need to process their values through <em><strong>ImageUrl</strong></em> or <em><strong>FileUrl</strong></em> extension methods in views to get the final URL of the media file you want to display.

That's why a user-friendly error page is a must.</p>\n<h2>Errors in MVC websites</h2>\n<p>In general, there are two types of errors in ASP.NET MVC websites, and they are raised either by the MVC application itself or by the IIS.</p>\n<p>The following errors are typically raised by an MVC application:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The URL requested by the user doesn't match any route on the website.</li>\n  <li>The URL matches a route, but a specific controller or controller action isn't found.</li>\n  <li>Controller action returns <em>System.Web.Mvc.HttpNotFoundResult</em> by, e.g., calling the <em>HttpNotFound</em> method.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The IIS can raise the following errors:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>File the user requested doesn't exist.</li>\n  <li>There is no binding for the requested extension, e.g, <em>jpg1</em>.</li>\n  <li>Static file handler doesn't find the file on the disc.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Handling the 404 error</h2>\n<p>Any suitable response to a 404 error in a modern MVC application should ensure the following:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>It preserves the original request URL.</li>\n  <li>It doesn't respond with a 302 redirect.</li>\n  <li>It returns correct 404 HTTP status code.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Implementing the error page</h2>\n<p>In the ASP.NET framework,&nbsp;there is a number of approaches you can take to implement how your website deals with error pages.</p>\n<p>We recommend handling errors on the IIS level by creating a custom friendly error MVC page or a static&nbsp;<em>.html</em>&nbsp;page and specify the path to the error page in the application's <em>Web.config</em> using the&nbsp;<em>httpErrors</em>&nbsp;element.</p>\n<p>Regarding the content of the error page, you can implement any of the following scenarios:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Create a static <em>.html </em>page with a hard-coded content to display as an error message.</li>\n  <li>Create a general MVC page which contains user-friendly error message&nbsp;hard-coded in the view's markup (for details see how we developed the Medio Clinic's error page).</li>\n  <li>Give a full control over the content of the error page to editors. You can create a <em>NotFound</em> page type with a suitable URL pattern and provide editors with means, e.g., suitable form controls, to populate the page with content they want to link or promote to their customers. The editors will then use the page type and create a Not found error page in the content tree. (Using this approach, you'll also need to implement the features to retrieve the content of the page to the live site. The implemented custom error page will be just another item in the content tree, and you can follow the same steps you took to display, e.g., the <em>Home</em> and other pages on the Medio Clinic live site.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Setting IIS to handle 404 HTTP exceptions</h2>\n<p>If you decide to use any of the three approaches, you need to configure the behavior of your application when an error occurs. The following snippet sets that the IIS handles 404 HTTP errors.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-c_\">protected void Application_Error()\n{\n    // Sets 404 HTTP exceptions to be handled via IIS (behavior is specified in the \"httpErrors\" section in the Web.config file)\n    var error = Server.GetLastError();\n    if ((error as HttpException)?.GetHttpCode() == 404)\n    {\n        Server.ClearError();\n        Response.StatusCode = 404;\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n<h2>Creating a static HTML error page</h2>\n<p>Having a static .html page is arguably the safest possible approach. In some cases, it can be easier to develop, but it requires that you hard-code the styling of the page to match your website's layout and provide the user with a consistent experience.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if there is any change to the basic site's layout, such as if there are new items in the websites' navigation, you need to update also the code of your static error page to match the experience which brings unnecessary expenses.</p>\n<p>The following code snippet shows how to reference your error page in the Web.config's <em>system.WebServer</em> node.</p>\n[Inline content item resolver provided an invalid HTML 5 fragment (4:9). Please check the output for a content item mvc_404_error_static_page_httperrors_code_example of type CloudIntegration.Models.Cloud.CodeBlock.]\n<h2>Creating a custom MVC error page</h2>\n<p>To use all MVC features, such as already defined website's layout or dynamically resolved navigation menu, you can create a custom <em>NotFound</em> controller with actions that handle the errors you need and return suitable views. Again, you need to reference the path to the respective controller action in the <em>Web.config</em>. You can see this approach in use on the Medio Clinic website.</p>","instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"textWithCode","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":false},"_isOptional":false,"_classes":"","_id":"24e4bdef-30a2-4085-81cf-a91e206c937d","_parentId":"6fda4dcd-57da-4fd0-9d06-04852e70be60","_type":"component","title":"404 error pages in Kentico MVC","displayTitle":"404 error pages in Kentico MVC"},{"body":"<p>Medio Clinic uses a custom user-friendly error MVC page.</p>\n<p>The site's <a href=\"https://github.com/Kentico/training-kentico-k12/blob/master/MedioClinic/Global.asax.cs\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Global.asax</em></a><em> </em>sets that the errors are handled by the IIS<em>. </em>The behavior is specified in the site's <a href=\"https://github.com/Kentico/training-kentico-k12/blob/master/MedioClinic/Web.config\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>web.config</em></a> which defines handling error by an <em>&lt;httpErrors&gt;</em> element added to the <a href=\"https://github.com/Kentico/training-kentico-k12/blob/master/MedioClinic/Web.config\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Web.config</em></a>'s <em>web.webServer</em> section.</p>\n<p>The <em>\"/notfound\"</em> &nbsp;path's attribute of the <em>&lt;error&gt;</em> element matches the <em>NotFound route</em> in the <a href=\"https://github.com/Kentico/training-kentico-k12/blob/master/MedioClinic/App_Start/RouteConfig.cs\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>RouteConfig.cs</em></a> class.
