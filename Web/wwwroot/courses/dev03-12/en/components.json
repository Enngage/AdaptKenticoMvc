websites use two separate web applications.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The MVC application displays the live site and the Kentico application provides the administration interface.</p>\n<p>The MVC application runs on the standard ASP.NET MVC 5 framework.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Kentico serves as a content repository and provides a simple and easy to understand administration interface that empowers content editors and online marketers with a long list of functionality for editing content or running online marketing activities.</p>\n<p>The administration interface of the Kentico application is built on ASP.NET Web Forms, and can be widely customized and made to fit almost any user scenario.</p>\n<p>Both applications run on their own URLs and but they share the same database.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Website editors create and manage the content in the Kentico application which is displayed on the live site through the Kentico API.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Kentico API is integrated into the MVC application as NuGet packages and its libraries provide an extensive functionality for a large number of client scenarios.</p>\n<p>Ranging from small, single-purpose microsites for marketing campaigns over medium-size business websites with e-stores all the way up to large-scale portals with large teams of editors working on different continents and with millions of website visitors from different cultures.</p>\n<p>Any change to the live site or in the admin interface is automatically synchronized, as both applications are running in a web farm.</p>\n<p>It is the shared database and the Kentico API that allow both applications to work as a web farm and ensure that changes in one of the applications are immediately reflected in the other.</p>\n<p>The synchronization options cover various types of data, including cached database content, settings of the site or individual objects, or uploaded files.</p>\n<p>When a web editor changes the text of a page in the admin interface, the data is stored in the database.</p>\n<p>Then the Kentico application initiates a synchronization task and triggers a task for the MVC application.</p>\n<p>The MVC application runs the task and invalidates the matching data in its cache.</p>\n<p>When a website's visitor requests the content that has been updated the MVC application retrieves the updated content from the database and serves it on the live site.</p>\n<p>As editing of the content takes place in a separate application, the content which an editor updates doesn't need to be immediately promoted to the live site.</p>\n<p>It can pass through complex content workflows which help large editor teams to ensure that only approved content is displayed to the website's audience.</p>\n<p>In summary, when developers build a website in Kentico MVC solution, they prepare two applications the front-facing MVC application and the administration interface, which both share the same database.</p>"},"_playerOptions":{"features":["playpause","progress","current","duration","speed","volume","fullscreen"]},"instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"media","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true},"_isOptional":false,"_classes":"","_id":"a36a840a-e901-46e8-ae04-28cdb5734639","_parentId":"5b9b499e-2d19-4405-9d3c-4606736fede6","_type":"component","title":"Overview

Transcript","inlineTranscriptBody":"<h1>Ways to store data in Kentico</h1>\n<p>Hi there. In this video, we are going to look at ways you can use to store content in Kentico. The content editors add the content in the administration interface which stores the data in a shared database. The data is then retrieved via the Kentico API to the live site running as a separate MVC application.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, pages are only one of the approaches you can use.&nbsp;Before you start defining your website architecture,&nbsp;let's see what options Kentico provides for storing the website's data.</p>\n<p>Besides already mentioned pages, you can use module classes, custom tables, and media libraries.</p>\n<p>Pages are the most common way to store data on websites.&nbsp;Editors&nbsp;can also add files to pages as attachments. One of the benefits of storing data in pages is that you can display them in a visual hierarchy in the content tree.</p>\n<p>Seeing pages in hierarchy helps content editors, as they can quickly navigate around and easily pick the content they want to manage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Storing content in pages also allows you to configure access permissions for editors down to individual pages, and define detailed reviewing and approval processes using workflows. Lastly, you can use pages to store content in different languages and manage translations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The second option is to use custom module classes.&nbsp;Custom module classes allow you to store large amounts of content. They are extremely helpful when you need to access the stored data in the admin interface, but don't want to display it in the visual hierarchy of the content tree.</p>\n<p>For example, you can use custom module classes&nbsp;when you want to create a specialized interface within the admin UI through which the editors will add and manage data.</p>\n<p>Custom module classes also provide the best options if you need to model relationships between different types of data or integrate advanced custom functionality. So, that's custom module classes.</p>\n<p>The third option to store a large amount of data is to use custom tables. Custom tables allow you to create your custom database tables and manage their content directly from the administration interface without using any specialized database management tool. They come in handy when you need to store a large amount of data in a flat structure.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Content editors can access the data stored in custom tables from the administration interface,&nbsp;but this data will not be displayed in a visual hierarchy as pages in the content tree.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So when to use custom module classes, and when the custom tables? Well,&nbsp;it depends on the use case.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you need editors to add records&nbsp;through a custom-built user interface within Kentico, use custom module classes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And if your editors just need to add or update the data in a simple, table-like interface, use custom tables.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The last available option for storing data are media libraries. Media libraries are designed to store large files, such as images, videos or packaged files. You can also use them to store your files externally and distribute them through CDNs. You will learn about media libraries and how to work with them later in the course.</p>\n<p>These are the four options you can use to store data in Kentico.&nbsp;Analyze your project requirements and decide which option fits best your client's needs.</p>\n<p>Either you decide to use the hierarchy of pages, store large files in media libraries, extend functionality with custom module classes&nbsp;or store a flat data structure in custom tables, make certain you understand how and when you can use them. This will make sure you pick the best option for your client's needs.</p>"},"_playerOptions":{"features":["playpause","progress","current","duration","speed","volume","fullscreen"]},"instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"media","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true},"_isOptional":false,"_classes":"","_id":"17834fc6-9471-40ba-ae3e-9eb6947a09f4","_parentId":"fcf91950-497b-4de8-bb25-d43df578392c","_type":"component","title":"Ways to store data in Kentico","displayTitle":"Ways to store data in Kentico"},{"_setCompletionOn":"play","_useClosedCaptions":true,"_allowFullScreen":true,"_media":{"mp4":"https://assets-eu-01.kc-usercontent.com:443/63117da1-007f-01dd-86eb-23e8353ac375/99d3b344-ffcf-418b-b817-b41948b36fb8/mvc-editing-content-in-kentico-mvc.mp4","poster":"https://assets-eu-01.kc-usercontent.com:443/63117da1-007f-01dd-86eb-23e8353ac375/810fe2b7-367a-4754-addd-a980801e352a/mvc-editing-content-loading-page.png","cc":{"srclang":"en","src":null}},"_transcript":{"_setCompletionOnView":true,"_inlineTranscript":true,"_externalTranscript":false,"inlineTranscriptButton":"Transcript","InlineTranscriptCloseButton":"Close Transcript","inlineTranscriptBody":"<h1>Editing content in Kentico</h1>\n<p>Hello there. In this video, we'll look at two approaches editors can use to add and manage the content on Kentico MVC websites.</p>\n<p>As a developer, you need to build the website so it continues to appeal to the audience, and at the same time, provides a consistent look and predictable experience.</p>\n<p>This is can be easily achieved by strictly limiting editors so that they can work only with content without any option to influence how the content looks on the live site.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, there are situations in which you'd want to empower the editor with more control over the content and the layout of the website.</p>\n<p>The question is, how can you provide an experience to fit both? With Kentico MVC, editors can manage content in the Administration interface as highly structured content, and through the Kentico page builder.</p>\n<p>Structured content allows editors to focus only on the quality of their content. Developers prepare the structure for collecting the content. They define exactly what type of content, like headlines, body copy, images or file attachments each page will store and create the markup which displays the content in the live site application in a unified way.</p>\n<p>Structured content works best for pages with a repeated layout across the website, where the focus is on the provided information rather than on first grabbing attention and then providing information later.</p>\n<p>Typically, you will use structured content with articles, product pages or pages which don't personalize their content depending on who is viewing them, like the About page or Contact page.</p>\n<p>In some situations, content editors need to personalize the page experience to fit the audience, and that's when the Kentico page builder comes in handy.</p>\n<p>The page builder provides a user-friendly interface which allows even non-technical users to create and adjust the position of the content.</p>\n<p>A developer prepares pages which contain editable areas, as well as the components that can be added and content editors select the look they want their page to have, adjust it a bit if needed and populate it with exactly the types of content in exactly the locations on the page they have identified to achieve their goals.</p>\n<p>Typically, you will use the page builder on pages where you want to adjust the layout and content elements to fit the message, such as campaign landing pages.</p>\n<p>It's also great for pages that receive the highest amount of traffic, such as the Homepage where editors or marketers want to frequently adjust messaging to fit the company's current marketing goals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Both options have their place on MVC websites. As always, define your website architecture so that it best meets your client needs.</p>"},"_playerOptions":{"features":["playpause","progress","current","duration","speed","volume","fullscreen"]},"instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"media","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true},"_isOptional":false,"_classes":"","_id":"d36d0a0d-97ba-45d0-8a74-ef93f6d67fdc","_parentId":"6cc0bfda-9601-46d3-a402-e1c9a4ab48d0","_type":"component","title":"Editing content in Kentico MVC","displayTitle":"Editing content in Kentico MVC"},{"body":"<p><strong>Kentico Installer</strong>&nbsp;performs a number of operations.

It also limits the number of locations that directly call the Kentico API and makes it easier to deal with changes in the API when upgrading to newer versions.</li>\n  <li>The <a href=\"https://autofaccn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/integration/mvc.html?highlight=resolver\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Autofac dependency injection container</a> is used to instantiate services, repositories and other interface implementations (both for the custom-built classes and ones from the Kentico API).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>MedioClinic project</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Standard MVC web application project structure: controllers, models, views, configuration files, startup logic, etc.</li>\n  <li>Contains all front-end design files and content items required for the website (stylesheets, scripts, images, resource files).</li>\n  <li>Integration with the Kentico API is provided by the installed <strong>Kentico.AspNet.Mvc</strong> NuGet package.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Business project</h3>\n<p>Enterprise-level applications usually require separation of business logic from the web application code. This makes it easier to maintain, distribute, and potentially reuse your code.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Contains custom&nbsp;<strong>Services</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Repositories</strong>, which use the Kentico API to retrieve data and perform other required actions.</li>\n  <li>The <strong>Dto</strong> folder stores <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">data transfer objects</a> used within the project. The Dto classes represent Kentico pages and objects, but carry only the minimum required data. For example, they are used within the properties of model classes that transfer data to the website's views.</li>\n  <li>The <strong>Extensions</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Models</strong>&nbsp;folders store custom extension methods and classes that wrap the Kentico API. For example, instead of directly calling the Kentico API to localize resource strings, you call the custom <em>Localize</em> method within views. If the Kentico API changes in future versions, you just need to update your custom <em>Localize</em> method, not all occurrences of code that localize resource strings.</li>\n  <li>The <strong>DI</strong>&nbsp;folder contains classes that register services into the Autofac dependency injection container (these are used in the startup logic of the MVC web application). For detailed information about registering services from the Kentico API, see our <a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/developing-websites/initializing-kentico-services-with-dependency-injection\">documentation</a>.</li>\n  <li>The <strong>Generated</strong> folder contains generated classes for managing the Page types used on the website.</li>\n  <li>The Kentico API is integrated through the <strong>Kentico.Libraries</strong> NuGet package (this project is only a code library, so the full <em>Kentico.AspNet.Mvc</em> package is not required).</li>\n</ul>","instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"textWithCode","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true},"_isOptional":false,"_classes":"","_id":"f27815a9-a0be-47c2-bf87-d9cd2eab7e82","_parentId":"eb346380-3f46-4518-bc3e-a2d522fbf60c","_type":"component","title":"Medio Clinic Implementation Overview","displayTitle":"Medio Clinic Implementation Overview"},{"body":"<p>To get the most from the course, you will be building a simple website for our imaginary Medio clinic.

They also cannot use features that rely on the preview mode, such as the page builder, or create hyperlinks to pages in the content tree using the built-in text editor. To enable editors to fully leverage the power of the Kentico MVC development model, you need to specify a <strong>URL pattern</strong> for your page types.</p>\n<h3>The URL pattern</h3>\n<p>The <strong>URL pattern</strong> specifies how the system resolves the page's URL within the administration interface. The system combines the URL pattern with the site's presentation URL and creates the overall display URL of the page.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The URL pattern comes in especially&nbsp;handy for pages which are presented separately on the live site. On the other hand, you don't need to set a URL pattern for pages &nbsp;in the content tree that do not represent distinct pages on the live site. In some cases, you may have pages whose content is aggregated in a different page, which then presents a complete page on the live site. For example, you can show all company offices listed on one page on the live site, but store information about each office in a separate page in the content tree. If you don't need to display individual offices on separate pages, you don't need to set a URL pattern for the 'office' page type, but only for the listing 'offices' type.</p>\n<h3>Macros in URL patterns</h3>\n<p>By adding macro expressions representing page properties into the URL pattern, you can set presentation URLs for separate pages based on the same page type, or different language versions of the same page. Using macro variables in your patterns is particularly important on larger sites with multiple cultures.</p>\n<p>Kentico macro expressions use the object-oriented <strong>K# </strong>language, which is very similar to the C# programming language. The system identifies string as a macros when you enclose the expression into curly brackets with a percentage sign: <em>{% MacroExpression %}</em>. To learn more about the K# language, other parameters you can use, and creating advanced macro expressions, visit our <a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/macro-expressions/macro-syntax\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>To find out what node and page data is available for your URL pattern macro expressions, you can look into the built-in Kentico macro console. Navigate to the <strong>System </strong>application, select the <strong>Macros </strong>&gt; <strong>Console </strong>tab and type, e.g., <em>CurrentDocument.</em> into the console. The macro autocomplete feature will list all the properties that are available in the page and node data.</p>\n<p>The most common way to address a page on MVC sites is to use the {% <em>NodeAlias %}</em> macro, which retrieves the page alias and helps to create more SEO-friendly URLs.</p>\n<p>Besides the pages aliases, you can also add the {% <em>DocumentCulture %}</em> macro to the URL pattern, which resolves into the culture code of the page's currently active content culture.</p>\n<p>For example, when a page type for blog articles has the following URL pattern:</p>\n<p><em>{% DocumentCulture %}/Articles/{% NodeAlias %}</em></p>\n<p>An article, e.g., '<em>The Magical Health Benefits of Being Cold</em>' in the Medio Clinic website's US English culture, has the following live URL:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>http://medioclinic.com/en-US/Articles/The-Magical-Health-Benefits-of-Being-Cold</em></p>\n<p>where '<em>en-US</em>' is the culture code and '<em>The-Magical-Health-Benefits-of-Being-Cold</em>' is the article's page alias.</p>\n<div class=\"infobox note\"><p>We do not recommend using query string parameters in URL patterns. When the system generates the <em>Preview</em> <em>URLs</em> for pages based on the specified pattern, it removes any parameters.</p></div>\n<p>Macro expressions in the URL pattern help you create more robust system logic, which is ready to serve when you need to start scaling up your application.&nbsp;</p>","instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"textWithCode","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true},"_isOptional":false,"_classes":"","_id":"c6509777-b455-4f56-83db-cbd333015b07","_parentId":"51a2c7c1-bb28-4085-ad2e-b697e9091e5f","_type":"component","title":"Theory: URL Pattern","displayTitle":"URL pattern"},{"body":"<p>Kentico provides options to website editors who want to attach files to pages in the content tree. Typical examples of uploaded attachments are PDF files or images.</p>\n<p>Unlike files stored in media libraries, which are covered later in the course, attached files are associated with the pages they have been uploaded to. If editors move or copy the page with the associated files in the content tree, the attachments are moved or copied together with the page.</p>\n<p>Developers can prepare page types to store attachments by adding fields with the following data types:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>File</strong> fields allow editors to upload a single attachment file. Editors use the <em>Direct uploader</em> form control on the <strong>Content</strong> tab in the <strong>Pages</strong> application to add, update or remove the file. If you want to use the <em>File</em> data type for multiple attachments on a single page, you need to create a separate field for each file you want editors to upload.</li>\n  <li><strong>Attachments</strong> fields provide a way to manage multiple attachments through a single page type field.

It provides a rich feature set and makes it easy to manage and serve content in different languages (cultures), both in the administration interface and on the live site. Kentico supports several approaches to localization, from long structured content stored as pages, to short, individual strings which for example serve as captions or title elements displayed in the footer of your website.</p>\n<h2>Localizing content of pages</h2>\n<p>Before website editors can start localizing content, developers or administrators need to assign the required cultures to the site (this can be done in the <strong>Sites</strong> application). By default, the system contains all commonly used cultures, but you can extend the list in the <strong>Localization</strong> application on the <strong>Cultures</strong> tab if necessary. These cultures do not automatically provide any actual translations of text, they only determine which language/culture options are available for the website.</p>\n<p>Multilingual content of pages can be managed in the <strong>Pages</strong> application. A site with multiple cultures stores different language variants of content in separate versions of pages in the content tree. The website editors can translate content themselves, or they can use connectors to translation services and assign translation tasks to get the content in the languages they need.</p>\n<h3>Available translation services</h3>\n<p>The integrated translation services take content prepared in one language and create its variant in another language. To create the multilingual website, the \"translators\" don't need to edit the text in the Kentico administration interface. Kentico automatically ensures data transfer between the website pages and translation providers in the standardized XLIFF format.</p>\n<p>Machine services programmatically convert source text from one language to another (by default, Kentico provides services for <strong>Microsoft Translator</strong> and <strong>Google Translate</strong>). You can also connect your website to human translation services, such as the default <strong>Translations.com</strong> service. However, you are not limited to these three services. Kentico is a highly-customizable solution, and you can develop <a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/custom-development/miscellaneous-custom-development-tasks/developing-custom-translation-services\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">custom translation services</a>.</p>\n<p>The system also provides manual translation services that allow editors to <strong>send content for translation via email</strong>, or <strong>export the translation data</strong> to the file system. In both cases, the export package contains <em>.xlf</em>&nbsp;files.&nbsp;Once the content is translated, the packages need to be imported back to the system manually.</p>\n<p>Find out more about how <a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/multilingual-websites/configuring-translation-services/human-translation-services-email-translation\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">email</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/multilingual-websites/configuring-translation-services/human-translation-services-manual-translation\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">manual</a> translation services work or how you can <a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/multilingual-websites/configuring-translation-services\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">configure the translation services</a> in our documentation.</p>\n<h2>Editing multicultural content in the Pages application</h2>\n<p>With a correctly set <strong>URL pattern</strong> for page types, website editors can preview the default and other culture versions of pages in the content tree. Depending on the culture they are editing, website editors can also assign different workflows and submit different culture variants of the pages to culture-specific approval processes.</p>\n<div class=\"infobox note\"><p>In the training website for this course, we use the <em>{%DocumentCulture%}</em> macro in page type URL patterns. This macro resolves into the culture code of the language selected in the Pages application, which ensures that the URL contains a culture prefix and the correct language variant is displayed in the preview.</p></div>\n<h2>Localizing individual strings on the website</h2>\n<p>Not all content on the website needs to be stored in the <strong>Pages </strong>application. Reusable pieces of text, like contact details, captions, titles, or other individual strings on the live site don't need to be added or edited in the website's content tree.</p>\n<p>With the Kentico MVC development model, you can use the standard .NET approach and localize individual pieces of text using resource strings, stored in either <em>.resx</em> files or the database.</p>\n<div class=\"infobox note\"><p>If you are not familiar with the .NET concept of <strong>string resources</strong>, they are simple <em>key/value pairs</em> of string data. Each key can have a different value for a specific culture.</p>\n<p>With Kentico you can add the string keys into your website's content, either by using special expression within text, or by calling the appropriate API in code. The strings then resolve into the correct value based on the relevant culture context.</p></div>\n<h3>Working with resource strings</h3>\n<p>Storing resource strings within resource files has a considerable disadvantage: if you - or even the website editors - want to change anything on a running production site, you need to update the related strings in the files, and then redeploy the website.</p>\n<p>Kentico provides you with a great option - editors can manage resource strings directly in the administration interface. Editors with special permissions (<strong>Localize strings </strong>permission for the <strong>Localization</strong> module) can create the strings in the <strong>Localization </strong>application on the <strong>Resource strings</strong> tab. Kentico stores strings added through the administration interface in the website's database (in the <em>CMS_ResourceString</em> and <em>CMS_ResourceTranslation</em> tables).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can combine both approaches and the system loads resource strings from all available sources (by default, strings in the database have priority over strings in resource files).</p>\n<p>Find out more about working with resource strings in the Kentico <a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/multilingual-websites/setting-up-a-multilingual-user-interface/working-with-resource-strings\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<h2>Localizing the administration interface</h2>\n<p>Kentico also provides the option to localize the administration interface, so that users feel at home when working with their website. Users can set the culture of the admin UI in their profiles. The interface culture determines not only the language of text in the interface, but also other factors like numeric and date formats.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>By default, the Kentico installation only provides an English (\"en-us\" culture) pack for the user interface texts. However, you can obtain packs for other languages from the Kentico community, or prepare your own translations of the used resource files.</p>\n<p>Kentico allows for managing content in any language, including double-byte (eastern) languages, such as Chinese. All content is stored and published in UNICODE.</p>\n<p>Find out more about setting up a multicultural UI in our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/multilingual-websites/setting-up-a-multilingual-user-interface\" data-new-window=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<h2>Serving multicultural content on the live site</h2>\n<p>Adding culture-specific routes, setting the current culture context, and retrieving multicultural page content through the Kentico API will be covered later in the course. So let's just get a basic overview to complete the picture of how Kentico MVC websites handle multicultural content.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The MVC development model allows creating of URLs with culture prefixes, which can help your website with SEO.</li>\n  <li>You can develop functionality that allows site visitors to manually switch between languages.</li>\n  <li>You need to ensure that you load the correct culture versions of pages when retrieving content in your website's code.</li>\n</ul>","instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"textWithCode","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true},"_isOptional":false,"_classes":"","_id":"fbe8ccba-374c-4e9f-8b62-3ab667e4e3a6","_parentId":"99c87c4a-fca6-4690-9792-bd2014da7713","_type":"component","title":"Multicultural sites","displayTitle":"Multicultural sites"},{"body":"<h2>1.
