That's great, as web analytics helps you monitor website performance. But do you have the insight necessary to actually start improving your website's performance? Understanding your website visitors and their behavior will help you take the right actions. For this, we have contact management</p>\n<p>Let's see how contact management can work for you. Let's say you're the owner of Nice Diced Ice, a construction company that builds igloos. Despite global warming, your website is visited by thousands of visitors looking for new homes. As soon as a new visitor arrives on your site, you want to start collecting as much information about them as possible. Though still anonymous, just the arrival gives you the visitor's traffic source, location, and more! As they take actions on your website, the system tracks the journey and logs which pages are visited and what's searched for, downloaded, watched, and so on. At some point this visitor fills in one of your online forms, so you know his name and email address.</p>\n<p>As choosing a new place to live takes a long time, he returns to your site multiple times, sometimes using different browsers and even different devices. Your website can automatically track his visits and behavior across multiple channels, merging them into a single contact profile.</p>\n<p>Each visitor and their information are then stored in Contact Management - your centralized hub for all details about all website visitors. Using this hub, you can get a 360-degree view of each visitor at a glance. You can use similar interests or characteristics to divide your contacts into groups and then improve their experiences by delivering content relevant to each group.</p>\n<p>You can even tailor the content of your website or emails to each individual visitor. You can look at their activities and score contacts most likely to buy. You can create workflows to build relationships with contacts who aren't yet ready. And you'll get a clear idea of your ideal customer and their journey together with a better understanding of how to help them along it.</p>\n<p>So you see, contact management means data and data means insights. Actively using contact management can help you: get deeper insight into visitors and their journeys, improve your management of contacts, and increase your efficiency across teams.</p>\n<p>Take a look at your own contacts and see what you can learn.</p>"},"_playerOptions":{"features":["playpause","progress","current","duration","speed","volume","fullscreen"]},"instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"media","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true},"_isOptional":false,"_classes":"","_id":"0d3d8461-a8c7-4755-a26d-49fa8b04e0c3","_parentId":"8c520e99-c89f-4001-9347-bd1d026382cd","_type":"component","title":"Why Use Contact Management","displayTitle":"Why Use Contact Management"},{"body":"<p>Every visitor of a Kentico-powered website (which is using online marketing features) is considered a&nbsp;<strong>contact</strong>.

That's great, except how do you know which ones are interested to you and your business? Some visitors came to you by accident, some are looking for something you offer, but are not ready to buy, some are already clued into what you're offering and these hot leads are ready to buy ... now! But how do you find these needles in your haystack? The solution is: lead scoring.</p>\n<p>You can target your hottest leads first, closing the easiest sales. Then you can work down, focusing on instilling trust in those who need a little encouragement. To simplify this task, you filter out the poorest scorers, so as not to waste time on the wrong sort of visitor.</p>\n<p>So how can lead scoring work for you? As your visitor browses your website, you can trace their actions and see what is watched, clicked, and downloaded and whether the visitor comes back to your website for more. For each of these activities, your visitor is assigned points and these inform you about how much they've learned about your offer so far. This information represents implicit data gathered automatically to tell your about your visitor's engagement with your business. You may also be provided with personal data, such as when the visitor submits a form to get more details about your offers.</p>\n<p>You can then assign points based on the quality and relevance of the data provided. This information represents explicit data showing you how well the visitor fits your business. Examples of implicit data you gather might include the number of visited pages, the number of times the visitor returned to your website, which videos they watched, and what they downloaded. You choose which implicit data to collect based on what's important for your business. Examples of explicit data you gather might include the visitor's region, phone number, job title, and mailing address.</p>\n<p>If you score each visitor with your own lead scoring rules, you can identify visitors who score well in terms of engagement AND fit to your business. And that's your hot lead. Your visitors are then grouped by score, with your hot leads in the top right group.</p>\n<p>Within the overall score, the further right the group, the more engaged the leads are, the higher the group, the better they fit your business. Your hot leads are ready to buy, and so require a quick response right now. Those visitors scored as warm leads are undecided and need further nurturing from you. And visitors scored as cold leads can be ignored for the moment.</p>\n<p>So you see, using lead scoring can save time and increase sales by helping you focus on where you can get the greatest returns.</p>"},"_playerOptions":{"features":["playpause","progress","current","duration","speed","volume","fullscreen"]},"instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"media","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true},"_isOptional":false,"_classes":"","_id":"197e3364-b151-45c1-b435-89e0f98986cc","_parentId":"2b100701-bc4c-4f89-ac14-02567cf96f19","_type":"component","title":"Why Use Lead Scoring","displayTitle":"Why Use Lead Scoring"},{"body":"<p>Visitors come to your website every day and do various things – they read your blog posts, get to know more about your company, and find out about your offers.

In this video, I'm going to show you how to set up lead scoring in Kentico.</p>\n<p>I'll go to my Scoring application and create a new score. I'll give it a name and then add in a&nbsp;description about finding people who are interested in partnering with us so our sales team can follow up and promote all the benefits of our partnership program. Since I want my sales team involved, I'll choose a score at which notifications will be sent and enter the sales team's email address to receive them. I'll save these settings and then go to my Rules tab to get started with the score.</p>\n<p>I'll add a new rule to give a place for people to gain points. I'll start with just a basic rule about having people's emails, which has a small value for me. For this, I can stick with an Attribute, choose email</p>\n<p>and give points if it's not empty. Then I'll save this rule.</p>\n<p>I'll create another rule. This one I'll make about people considering a large purchase, which shows more interest in my business. I'll choose for this to be an Activity. Then I change the activity to putting something in their cart and choose as my most expensive product, which is targeted at businesses.</p>\n<p>Then I can save the rule and move on to the next.</p>\n<p>Now I want a rule about interest in wholesale partnership which is worth more points to me. People can express their interest through a specific part of a form, so I'll make this rule a macro and edit it. I'll&nbsp;add a rule about a specific field, choose the right form and field and then enter the text that shows their interest. And save the rule.</p>\n<p>For my next rule, I remember that Sales has complained about not the leads in China they get not resulting in very many deals. So I'll take away some points for contacts in China. This can stay as an Attribute. I just need to select Country and then find China. Once I save my rule, I have everything I need.</p>\n<p>I'm notified that my score isn't up to date, so I'll go back to an overview of my rules and recalculate the score to check which of my contacts match the rules I've set.</p>\n<p>I'm not worried about my website being slowed down by this, so I'll do it now. Then if I go to my Contacts tab, I can see all of the contacts who have scores and even view the activities that led to those scores. My sales team will get emails about each of the high scorers who reached the threshold I set.</p>\n<p>So that's how you can set up a score to find the most promising leads so you can follow up and nurture them along their journey.</p>"},"_playerOptions":{"features":["playpause","progress","current","duration","speed","volume","fullscreen"]},"instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"media","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true},"_isOptional":false,"_classes":"","_id":"ab07bee0-33cf-4f89-9c2f-fbb3c59a55a4","_parentId":"6ac1d03a-e674-4289-874e-b3cf032266a6","_type":"component","title":"How to set up lead scoring","displayTitle":"How to set up lead scoring"},{"body":"<p>You know that keeping track of your leads can help you nurture them along their journey to making a purchase. Setting up a score for your leads helps you figure out where they are in your funnel. But how and where should you start?&nbsp;Below, you can find some best practices to help you.</p>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Determine</strong> whether lead scoring is right for you. Use lead scoring if you are getting a fair amount of leads, but many of them are not ready to purchase.</li>\n  <li><strong>Work together</strong>. Make sure your marketing and sales teams are on the same page. Lead scoring transcends both fields.</li>\n  <li>Do your <strong>research</strong>. Start by analyzing your current customers and prospects. Find out what they have in common, what activities they've done on your website, and what you've found out about them from your interactions.</li>\n  <li>Use the<strong> right data</strong>. You want to make sure to use only data that's relevant to your score. For example, when creating lead scoring in a B2B environment, some demographic data such as age may be unimportant.</li>\n  <li>Consider <strong>demographics</strong> and <strong>behavioral</strong> data. What kind of people are the most interested - what are their ages, job titles, location? What is their level of interest - how far along their journeys are your prospects?</li>\n  <li>Assign a <strong>negative</strong> score for <strong>undesirable</strong> actions or attributes. Do not be afraid to penalize leads for things that show a lack of interest/fit. These can include unsubscribing from newsletters, providing invalid email addresses, and non-fitting demographics.</li>\n  <li>Give scores based on <strong>importance</strong>. Evaluate how important your conditions are and assign scores accordingly. You can start by dividing them into several categories, such as crucial, important, relevant, and negative. This will help you see relative values.</li>\n  <li>Be <strong>open to re-evaluation</strong>. Your rules and point thresholds are not set in stone - you can change them based on results and feedback. You work in a dynamic and changing environment, so make sure your scores are also dynamic.</li>\n  <li><strong>Integrate</strong> your scores into your <strong>strategy</strong>. Lead scoring is not a stand-alone part of your marketing, but a part of your overall marketing and sales strategy.</li>\n  <li>Be <strong>patient</strong>. Setting up lead scoring is a process, and it takes time.</li>\n</ol>","instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"textWithCode","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true},"_isOptional":false,"_classes":"","_id":"d5260853-2810-40e3-a967-420c073c2391","_parentId":"349baebe-b120-4606-9116-4440dadb4f8c","_type":"component","title":"Lead scoring best practices","displayTitle":"Lead scoring best practices"},{"body":"<p>Lead scoring can prove useful in many cases.
