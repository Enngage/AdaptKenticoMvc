They share stuff like their name, e-mail, interface language and time zone to adjust the system clock to their needs. They sometimes like using personalized signatures to their messages. And they can also add other personal information, such as their social media presence and often their own avatars.</p>\n<p>In Kentico, you manage your user profile in the My Profile application.</p>\n<p>Let's start with the Details tab. You can add details like your name and nickname here, e-mail, your system language and time settings, your signature, your Skype account, and your avatar. Here, I am logged in as a user called Jeff Goetz - so you can see his email, signature, and also his avatar. Now, this avatar will not be displayed here in the user profile. Kentico displays avatars on the user's public profile, next to the user's name in forums posts or, for example, blog comments and other occasions.</p>\n<p>Below, the Change password tab is obvious - it allows you to change your password. While working with the training website, I strongly recommend changing your password to something you will remember.</p>\n<p>What about the Notifications tab?</p>\n<p>Based on the kind and size of your business, your website, and your team, it is sometimes useful to know about events that have taken place in the system. In Kentico, you can get different types of notifications. If you are in a managerial role, for example, you can get informed when your reportees submit articles or changes for your approval. The Notification tab in the My profile application lists all the notifications you are receiving from the system. Here, as you can see, Jeff receives notifications about changes other users have done to the content of the Dancing Goat website.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Similarly to Notifications tab, the Subscriptions tab here provides you with information about all the subscriptions you have on the website: newsletters, blog posts, message boards, forums, and such various system reports as web analytics reports. And now, let's move to the last tab - the Categories tab. Categories allow you to create and manage personal document categories. You can imagine categories as labels or tags that are assigned to content and you can use them to sort through the content. As you can see, Jeff here has a category called How to Articles with these two articles on the Dancing goat website. In this short video, we have covered the My profile application, which you can use to manage your basic profile information, password, notifications, subscriptions and categories for a different type of content. I hope you have enjoyed it.</p>"},"_playerOptions":{"features":["playpause","progress","current","duration","speed","volume","fullscreen"]},"instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"media","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true},"_isOptional":false,"_classes":"","_id":"0fb30ce9-9d85-434a-bae3-c572eb2f4d31","_parentId":"a2e84c7a-3002-4c0e-b947-a40594d0b65c","_type":"component","title":"My Profile application","displayTitle":"My Profile application"},{"_setCompletionOn":"play","_useClosedCaptions":true,"_allowFullScreen":true,"_media":{"mp4":"https://assets-us-01.kc-usercontent.com:443/95007ba5-806c-004f-8abe-e4d526f98c05/3c216d65-1212-447b-96b4-d224cab72d0f/Roles%20and%20permissions.mp4","poster":"https://assets-us-01.kc-usercontent.com:443/95007ba5-806c-004f-8abe-e4d526f98c05/9aa47c8b-2262-4644-8bb8-6c68163f2d07/roles-and-permissions-thumbnail.png","cc":{"srclang":"en","src":null}},"_transcript":{"_setCompletionOnView":true,"_inlineTranscript":true,"_externalTranscript":false,"inlineTranscriptButton":"Transcript","InlineTranscriptCloseButton":"Close Transcript","inlineTranscriptBody":"<p>Hello there, in this short video we will look at the basics of how Kentico understands different users.</p>\n<p>There are two basic types of people - website visitors who just visit your site for information or shopping, and users who can sign in to your website.</p>\n<p>Roles in Kentico define which actions users can perform on the live site and in the administration interface. There are many potential actions, including accessing different types of content like images, forms, and polls, accessing various applications within the system, editing or creating different page types, translating pages into different languages, adding new users, approving new content, and even developing whole new sites.</p>\n<p>Roles in Kentico get assigned different permissions in the Permissions application. Thanks to its interface, you can quickly tell which roles have which permissions assigned and you can adjust permissions to different roles according to your needs. Now, what about users?</p>\n<p>There are basically three types of users in Kentico - Editors, Administrators, and Global administrator. They differ in their privileges to perform actions on the website. Editors, which is the usual type of user for Content editors, usually can do things like editing page content, adding new forms, and running polls. Administrators in addition to working with content can also work with such areas as the design of the website and different applications. The last user-type, the Global Administrator, has full control of the site and can access all applications with the option to change the design and everything. Within this e-learning course, you will act as the Global Administrator of your training website.</p>\n<p>Users can manage information about themselves in the My Profile application, which is discussed in a different video. For working with users, Kentico has a dedicated Users application where you can manually add or delete individual users. And in this application, you can also tell which roles have which users assigned.</p>\n<p>All users with the Administrator privilege can \"impersonate\" other users. In other words, they can log in and work with the website as if they were other users. This feature is very useful when administrators are setting up the environment for different users. So, what does this look like?</p>\n<p>In the user menu up here, select impersonate. From the list of available users, select the one you want to become - for example, Andy. And now, when Andy's profile has loaded, you see the website's backend through his eyes and you can perform the actions he can perform. For example, because Andy is just an Editor, he can work with only a limited list of applications. To cancel the impersonation, simply open the User profile and select cancel impersonation from the menu. In this short introduction, we have covered the basics of users, roles, and permissions. The most important thing to remember is that in Kentico users are assigned to different roles and that these roles get permissions to access different content types or perform various actions.</p>\n<p>I hope you have found this information useful.</p>"},"_playerOptions":{"features":["playpause","progress","current","duration","speed","volume","fullscreen"]},"instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"media","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true},"_isOptional":false,"_classes":"","_id":"f5d27834-b092-4a3d-89db-a8c1d6fa58f8","_parentId":"d2fafd93-8ad1-49d3-9d47-51319e717440","_type":"component","title":"Basics of roles and permissions","displayTitle":"Basics of roles and permissions"},{"body":"<p>As you'll get to work on updating the content of the Dancing Goat site, you'll be often using a small number of applications.

In this video, we'll look at two approaches editors can use to add and manage the content on Kentico MVC websites.</p>\n<p>With Kentico MVC, editors can manage content in the Administration interface as highly structured content, and through the Kentico page builder.</p>\n<p>Structured content allows editors to focus only on the quality of their content. Developers prepare the structure for collecting the content. They define exactly what type of content, like headlines, body copy, images or file attachments each page will store and create the markup which displays the content in the live site application in a unified way.</p>\n<p>Structured content works best for pages with a repeated layout across the website, where the focus is on the provided information rather than on first grabbing attention and then providing information later.</p>\n<p>Typically, you will use structured content with articles, product pages or pages which don't personalize their content depending on who is viewing them, like the About page or Contact page.</p>\n<p>In some situations, content editors need to personalize the page experience to fit the audience, and that's when the Kentico page builder comes in handy.</p>\n<p>The page builder provides a user-friendly interface which allows even non-technical users to create and adjust the position of the content.</p>\n<p>A developer prepares pages which contain editable areas, as well as the components that can be added and content editors select the look they want their page to have, adjust it a bit if needed and populate it with exactly the types of content in exactly the locations on the page they have identified to achieve their goals.</p>\n<p>Typically, you will use the page builder on pages where you want to adjust the layout and content elements to fit the message, such as campaign landing pages.</p>\n<p>It's also great for pages that receive the highest amount of traffic, such as the Homepage where editors or marketers want to frequently adjust messaging to fit the company's current marketing goals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Both options have their place on MVC websites. As always, define your website architecture so that it best meets your client's needs.</p>"},"_playerOptions":{"features":["playpause","progress","current","duration","speed","volume","fullscreen"]},"instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"media","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true},"_isOptional":false,"_classes":"","_id":"6e10f5b2-619c-40d3-8a74-84d1a5dd9a0c","_parentId":"1bac87ae-0353-4460-9b9b-ed6dbf18631d","_type":"component","title":"Editing content in Kentico","displayTitle":"Editing content in Kentico"},{"body":"<p>As you already know, Kentico MVC gives developers and content editors a lot of freedom in how the website is implemented and what options and features are available.

As you probably know, hyperlinks (usually shortened to just links) form the basis for navigation around the internet. Links to and within your pages can also help you rise in the ranks of search engine results, so proper linking can be an essential part of an SEO strategy.</p>\n<p>Anchors are technically both the origin and destination of hyperlinks. People most commonly refer to anchors to mean the target of links, so that a link can point not just to a page as a whole but to a specific location within a page, which can be very useful if you have long pages with multiple sections. Anchors are also technically a part of each hyperlink.</p>\n<p>In HTML code, a hyperlink is formed using an anchor tag. These tags can get long and complicated as you add additional information to them. And if you forget a single detail like a quotation mark, the whole thing can break and be useless.

Simple, relevant, and compelling URLs help your visitors quickly recognize your website and it's structure. They improve user experience by helping them quickly understand what the destination page is about.&nbsp; When they share a good-looking URL on social media, the URL is attractive even when the website doesn't format the shared links (like Facebook).</p>\n<p>And if humans feel your URLs are easy-to-understand, you can bet that search engines feel the same. Though the URLs seem to be playing a minor role in the page ranking, a well-structured URL greatly improves user experience on the search result pages, especially in Google that displays the URL of the page in a \"<em>breadcrumb</em>\" format both for mobile and desktop searches.</p>\n<h3>Creating URLs in Kentico</h3>\n<p>On Kentico MVC websites, you can create any number of URLs for any page in the website. However, keep in mind that many features on the Kentico MVC website depend on how the site itself is implemented and URLs are no exception.</p>\n<p>If you've worked with Kentico Portal Engine websites, you might be surprised that URLs on MVC sites don't need to necessarily reflect 1-1 the content tree structure. What does it mean? For example, you can have a <em>thank you</em> page stored under its <em>parent landing page</em> in the content tree as you can see on the training website. In the Portal Engine site, the URL will respect the content tree and look like the following: <em>/Landing-Page/Partnership/Partnership-Thanks.</em> On the MVC live site URL of the page is <em>thank-you/partnership-thanks</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on your website implementation, there are different ways editors can modify the URL of the page. As an example, your company's website can have one of the following implementations:</p>\n<ul>\n  <ul>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Page's URL is defined by the page alias</strong>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Using the page alias to define the page's URL is the most common way of creating human-readable - thus SEO-friendly URLs. The <em>Page alias</em> is combined with the live site's domain name (aka <em>presentation URL</em>) and creates the page's URL.</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </ul>\n</ul>\n<figure data-asset-id=\"46b03f61-1962-4706-b479-763f3fdaf233\" data-image-id=\"46b03f61-1962-4706-b479-763f3fdaf233\"><img src=\"https://assets-us-01.kc-usercontent.com:443/95007ba5-806c-004f-8abe-e4d526f98c05/d2da8543-f6fa-4de8-ab73-2e7744dcf9f1/changing-page-alias.gif\" data-asset-id=\"46b03f61-1962-4706-b479-763f3fdaf233\" data-image-id=\"46b03f61-1962-4706-b479-763f3fdaf233\" alt=\"\"></figure>\n<div class=\"infobox note\"><p>Depending on your website's implementation, creating URLs through the page alias property might not be possible for all the pages in the content tree.

The MVC implementation is very different from the Portal Engine - and the URL's look-and-feel is defined by the site's developers. Let's have a look at how the URLs in MVC websites work.</p>\n<h3>Kentico administration and the live site application</h3>\n<p>You've already heard that Kentico runs two applications - the <em>live site application</em> and the <em>administration application</em> both of which run on a different <em>domain </em>(or a subdomain). The page's URL is determined by the live site's application routing engine - and it likely differs from the URL under which it's available in the content tree.</p>\n<p>As a website editor, you might think: Wait - two applications on two different URLs? How does then the admin application create, for example, hyperlinks from within the administration so that they point to resources on the live site application?</p>\n<p>In short, through <strong>URL patterns </strong>and live site's <strong>presentation URL</strong>.</p>\n<h3>URL pattern and site's presentation URL</h3>\n<p>Pages on the Kentico MVC websites (aka <em>content only pages</em>) don't have any presentation URL under which they can be located on the live site.</p>\n<h4>URL Pattern</h4>\n<p>When developers prepare content-only page types that editors use to create pages, they can define a <em>URL pattern </em>property. By the use of macro expressions (which are dynamically resolved text values), the <em>URL pattern</em> helps developers access data of the current pages within the content tree and resolve these values into individual segments of the page's live site URL.</p>\n<div class=\"infobox note\"><p>Note that not all the items in the content tree (their page types, respectively) will have the URL pattern defined (for example, individual cafés or items which put together the content of the <em>About Us </em>page (<em>Our philosophy</em>, <em>How we source our coffees</em>, etc.) on the training website.</p></div>\n<h4>Presentation URL</h4>\n<p>Each Kentico administration site contains a presentation URL property which is the <em>domain address</em> of the live site. &nbsp;You can check the presentation URL of your training website in the <em>Sites</em> application &gt; (edit) <em>DancingGoatMVC </em>&gt; <em>General </em>tab. (Don't change its value as it can lead to broken user experience in the <em>Pages </em>application!)</p>\n<h3>What happens when an editor creates a hyperlink from one article to another?</h3>\n<p>Let's take a closer, however, simplified, look.</p>\n<h4>Resolving the URL pattern into the live site URL</h4>\n<p>The <em>URL pattern</em> in the Kentico application can have a similar definition to the definition of a <em>route</em> (kind of a template for the URL in the MVC live site application). The <em>route</em> maps the incoming request for a page to a specific controller that in return serves the page to the website visitor. For example, let's say you want to create a hyperlink to the article <em>Coffee Beverages Explained</em>.</p>\n<p>Any article on the training website uses the following URL pattern:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>/{%DocumentCulture%}/Articles/{%NodeGUID%}/{%NodeAlias%}</em></p>\n<p>What do these values resolve to?</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Document culture macro</strong> returns current <em>culture version</em> of the page, e.g., <em>en-us</em>.</li>\n  <li><strong>Article</strong> defines the MVC <em>controller</em> that satisfies the visitor's request for a specific page, the <em>ArticleController.</em></li>\n  <li><strong>NodeGUID</strong> is <em>a unique idenitifier</em> of the page on the website, for example, <em>c3793d7a-cc6e-44b2-ab82-cbe8e2a86732.</em></li>\n  <li><strong>NodeAlias</strong> returns the <em>page alias</em> of the given page, <em>Coffee-Beverages-Explained.</em> (By default, Kentico uses dashes (-) to replace space character which is not allowed in URL. This setting can be overridden in the <em>Settings </em>application.)</li>\n</ul>\n<figure data-asset-id=\"1d1e484d-9d52-477e-b979-d7e0f94a8580\" data-image-id=\"1d1e484d-9d52-477e-b979-d7e0f94a8580\"><img src=\"https://assets-us-01.kc-usercontent.com:443/95007ba5-806c-004f-8abe-e4d526f98c05/79620c6f-634e-42af-bd7e-e72d24b10d7e/structure-of-the-url-advanced.png\" data-asset-id=\"1d1e484d-9d52-477e-b979-d7e0f94a8580\" data-image-id=\"1d1e484d-9d52-477e-b979-d7e0f94a8580\" alt=\"\"></figure>\n<h4>Creating the hyperlink</h4>\n<p>When you want to create a hyperlink to a page (from both the <strong>Page </strong>tab and <strong>Content </strong>tab in the <strong>Pages</strong> application), the page (it's<em> page type</em> respectively) needs to have the <em>URL pattern</em> property defined by the developers. (Otherwise, you won't be able to create the hyperlink.)</p>\n<p>Kentico takes the site's <strong>presentation URL</strong> (<em>http://us-03.kenticolab.com/Hosted_training_8965</em>) and <strong>combines </strong>it <strong>with values from the URL pattern</strong> <strong>into</strong> the <strong>live site URL</strong>: <em>http://us-03.kenticolab.com/Hosted_training_8965/en-US/Articles/c3793d7a-cc6e-44b2-ab82-cbe8e2a86732/Coffee-Beverages-Explained </em>and creates the hyperlink.</p>\n<p>A similar process happens when you <strong>preview </strong>the content of the live site within the administration interface using the <strong>Preview</strong> mode or work with content on the <strong>Page </strong>tab.</p>","instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"textWithCode","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true},"_isOptional":true,"_classes":"","_id":"91fc4f1b-e77b-47f3-ae7a-ff36e25ec432","_parentId":"69b7a7d9-8ebb-43b0-a253-aad7f7acbcbd","_type":"component","title":"Optional: Advanced URLs","displayTitle":"Optional: Advanced URLs"},{"body":"<p>Easy-to-read URLs help you gain well-deserved attention on search result pages.

That's where alternative URLs can help.</p>\n<p><strong>Alternative URLs</strong> allow you to create dedicated URLs for specific pages.

In simple words, on the backend, the visitor's browser requests another page on the website which then loads into their browser.

How? The alternative URL is changed by the server during processing the request for the page into a much less friendly-looking URL on the backend.</li>\n</ul></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure data-asset-id=\"a11dd24c-80a6-4686-94c0-88827f9f91d4\" data-image-id=\"a11dd24c-80a6-4686-94c0-88827f9f91d4\"><img src=\"https://assets-us-01.kc-usercontent.com:443/95007ba5-806c-004f-8abe-e4d526f98c05/b9b99dbd-caaf-4632-a0ac-1644d2332a96/adding-alternative-url.gif\" data-asset-id=\"a11dd24c-80a6-4686-94c0-88827f9f91d4\" data-image-id=\"a11dd24c-80a6-4686-94c0-88827f9f91d4\" alt=\"\"></figure>\n<h3>&nbsp;Alternative URLs in the website</h3>\n<p>Kentico automatically checks if the <strong>alternative URL</strong> you are creating isn't in conflict with:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Restrictions and excluded URLs website developers and admins defined.</li>\n  <li>The main URLs of existing pages on the website.</li>\n  <li>Other alternative URLs for any page on the same site.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Kentico prevents creating invalid URLs [1] and throws an error when you use, e.g., a forbidden URL character, such as \":\" or \"{}\". However, it is possible to create a URL which conflicts with a page's main URL [2] or matches with another alternative URL [3]. In these cases, Kentico displays a warning in the Pages application so that you resolve the conflict or contact administrator.</p>\n<p>Also, the alternative URL is <strong>website-specific</strong>, so to create an alternative URL for <strong>a different language</strong>, you need to switch the content-tree to the target culture and add an <strong>alternative URL with a different value</strong>.</p>\n<p>Out-of-the-box Kentico doesn't provide a way to see all the existing alternative URLs in the system, however, you can ask your developers to create a custom report containing many different values using the <strong>Reporting </strong>application.

The <strong>Metadata </strong>tab contains the following properties:</p>\n<p><strong>Page title</strong></p>\n<p>The page title is displayed to users in the header of their browser (or tab) when the page is viewed.

Using <strong>smart fields</strong> in your form, you can collect data gradually over different form submissions - and make them short and easy to complete.</p>\n<div class=\"infobox idea\"><h4><strong>How do smart fields work?</strong></h4>\n<p>Imagine you are offering several whitepapers in exchange for personal data customers submit through forms. You want to collect as much information as possible, but offering a lengthy online form with numerous fields lessens the chance that the customer will exchange this much information for a whitepaper. To improve your odds, you decide to split collecting the data into several steps. First, you mark some of the fields in your form as <em>smart fields. </em>Then, you display the same form on multiple website pages where your customers can request the whitepapers.</p>\n<p>When a user visits a page which contains your form, the page will show only an initial set of \"standard\" fields. When a visitor visits another page that contains the same form, they will now receive another set of fields which replace the fields this visitor has already filled. Your visitors submit their data in small chunks - until you have collected all the information you were interested in.</p></div>\n<p>To make smart fields work correctly, the system needs to know which users have already submitted the form - and which fields they have already filled. Kentico uses contact tracking feature developers have to implement (considering all the legal factors, such as GDPR). As a result, smart fields are never displayed to users who do not agree on tracking (or if your website doesn't have contact tracking enabled). These visitors will receive only the standard set of fields.</p>\n<p>Find out more about <a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12sp/managing-website-content/forms/using-smart-fields-in-forms\" data-new-window=\"true\" title=\"Using smart fields in forms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">smart fields in Kentico documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>Have a look at how easily you can turn any long form into smart field form:</p>\n<figure data-asset-id=\"1f736488-6427-450e-8226-ebdab16b242c\" data-image-id=\"1f736488-6427-450e-8226-ebdab16b242c\"><img src=\"https://assets-us-01.kc-usercontent.com:443/95007ba5-806c-004f-8abe-e4d526f98c05/d2165798-8f04-4e7a-a0b2-3f6e854f703f/Smart_fields.gif\" data-asset-id=\"1f736488-6427-450e-8226-ebdab16b242c\" data-image-id=\"1f736488-6427-450e-8226-ebdab16b242c\" alt=\"\"></figure>","instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"textWithCode","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true},"_isOptional":false,"_classes":"","_id":"67c8e8cb-1b7c-4ff9-8408-f09a82b956a2","_parentId":"d2dd2a80-4b32-4751-8eba-101b1ee6796c","_type":"component","title":"Using smart fields in forms","displayTitle":"Using smart fields in forms"},{"body":"<p>When your form is ready to collect all the necessary information, it's time to add it to your page.

Welcome to a video about media libraries in Kentico. In this video, you will learn all sorts of useful information, including how to create a media library and some basic things you can do there.</p>\n<p>You may already know that media libraries are one way of storing files in Kentico. They store files in a centralized location that multiple people can work with.</p>\n<p>You can find your media libraries in the conveniently named Media libraries application. Here, I can see a list of all media libraries that are already in my system or create a new one. I can navigate to any of them by clicking on the Edit button. I can also delete them if I no longer need them. The More options button reveals additional actions I can perform.</p>\n<p>I can choose Clone to duplicate the entire media library or just the structure without the files. Choosing Destroy would remove the media library and its files from Kentico. Choosing Export would allow me to export the contents of this media library - in contrast, the other option up here I have for exporting exports a list of my media libraries with their properties. The backup and restore functions help protect your data in case something goes wrong.</p>\n<p>Let's have a look at a situation that might be similar to the one you'd go through. I'm building up my content for my partnership campaign and want to have all of my files in a single location where other editors will have access so they can help me spread the word and be able to reuse the files elsewhere. I'm going to use a media library to easily grant access and cut out the need to re-upload files each time I want to use them.</p>\n<p>To create a new media library, I'll click the \"New media library\" and fill in basic information about my media library - names for the entire library and its first folder. I could also upload a teaser image and paste in a short description so that other editors know what this library is for.</p>\n<p>Once I hit Save, I'm automatically directed to a page where I can manage my files. I can upload files one by one or in bulk. I have a bunch of files of various types related to partnership, and even though I don't need them all right now, I can upload them together to store them for future use.</p>\n<p>After they are uploaded, all of the files appear on my list with some action buttons and basic properties. These two buttons above my list allow me to switch from a list view to thumbnails views so I can see a preview of all files with that option. Notice that the files have the same action buttons as in the list view.</p>\n<p>If you want different content stored in different places, you can structure a media library's contents using folders. In my case, I'll click on the New folder button to add in a folder for pictures of existing partner companies and another one where my sales team can upload video testimonials. I can also organize my library by taking actions like deleting, copying, and moving folders.</p>\n<p>I can also click on the Tab expand button to see other options I have for my media library. Under the General tab, I can change the initial properties I added, though you can see that the folder name can't be changed from here now.</p>\n<p>The Security tab gives me the options to control who exactly can work with my media libraries. Here, I'll change the top options to authorized roles so only my fellow content editors and administrators can change my library's settings, rather than everyone on my site.</p>\n<p>So now you know how to create media libraries, organize them, and adjust their settings. I hope you have found this video useful for your own media libraries.</p>"},"_playerOptions":{"features":["playpause","progress","current","duration","speed","volume","fullscreen"]},"instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"media","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true},"_isOptional":false,"_classes":"","_id":"72069a75-4922-48dc-ac93-7d920d21fc5e","_parentId":"a6a8e8e9-063e-4822-99f9-176ba43c51e6","_type":"component","title":"Media libraries","displayTitle":"Media libraries"},{"body":"<p>After you upload your files to a media library, you have plenty of options on what you can do with the files or the whole folders.</p>\n<p>You can copy, move or delete them. But keep in mind that when you work with the files used on your live website, any change like this can influence how they are displayed on the live site.</p>\n<div class=\"infobox warning\"><p><strong>Moving files between folders and libraries may break your content</strong></p>\n<p>When you move a media library file into a different folder and the file is already used on some of your pages (e.g., the file is set as a background image in a widget on your Home page), the file may become unavailable.&nbsp;This can happen if your website isn't set to use <em>permanent </em>media library URLs. (That's something your developers need to configure.)</p>\n<p>If you move a file, you need to manually update the file on each page so that it is retrieved from the new location and correctly displayed.</p></div>\n<h3>Limit number of images per media library folder</h3>\n<p>When you create a new folder, you can immediately start adding its files. Although Kentico doesn't limit the number of folders you can create, we strongly recommend that you don’t upload more than <strong>100 files</strong> to your folder to keep the UI run smoothly.</p>\n<p>Why? Because the number of files in one folder directly affects the performance of the<em> Media library</em> application. If you want to store more than 100 files, you can always split it into several folders. Not only will this improve the speed of your UI, but it will also make the folders look much clearer and easier to work with.</p>\n<p>This limitation applies only&nbsp;if your files are stored in Azure Blob storage or the AWS, so be sure to ask your developers how your storage is configured.</p>\n<h3>Editing media library files</h3>\n<p>When working with specific files, the options depend on the type of file.</p>\n<p>With <strong>images</strong>, you can open the built-in image editor you are already familiar with. For <strong>files </strong>that are not images, you can only change their basic properties, such as the file's <em>name</em>, <em>title</em>, and <em>description</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"infobox note\"><p>Although you can always change your images using the built-in Kentico image editor, we suggest that you edit your files before uploading them to the media libraries. Doing so, you know exactly how your image will look, and you don’t have to worry whether you resized or cropped it correctly in the image editor. Further, the Kentico image editor uses <em>lossy editing </em>(and <em>compression</em> in case you update the file size or type). The editor <em>overwrites</em> the original image properties with new ones in the database. As a result, you won't be able to revert the image back to the original if you're happy with your changes.</p></div>","instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"textWithCode","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true},"_isOptional":false,"_classes":"","_id":"2c835446-319e-4667-b1eb-4252d7b23d1c","_parentId":"e92e4bd7-a514-4995-87a2-446518da6fb9","_type":"component","title":"Working with media library files","displayTitle":"Working with media library files"},{"body":"<p>You can add files stored in your media libraries into different places on the website.</p>\n<p>When the files are already in your media library (and you don't need to re-upload them), you can insert them into a text region using the&nbsp;<strong>Insert/Edit image or media</strong>&nbsp;button.

You already know what workflows are, so in this video we'll focus on a specific scenario of how they look in practice. I'll show you how a workflow looks when one person (in my case Andy) makes changes and another person (in my case Laura) approves them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To start with, instead of working with my website as a global administrator, I'm going to impersonate Andy, one of my site's content editors. As Andy, I'll go to my Pages application and then to my article about brewing. Notice that at the top, Kentico notifies me that a workflow has been applied to this page, tells me the step it's in, and shows that in this case I need to create a new version in order to work with the page.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Creating the new version checks this page out to me. Once I have created a new version, you'll notice that a couple of things have changed about my page. For one, I now have the ability to save my work. Also, in the content tree, my page's status has changed. The lock icon shows me that I have checked this page out, meaning no one else can work with it now. The diamond shows me that my new version has not yet gone through approval and so is not published.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If I decide I don't want to keep working with the page right now, I could check it back in to free it up for others. I can even choose the More options button to check it back in with a comment, so my colleagues know I'm coming back to it. You can see that the lock icon goes away and I get a notification that I can't make changes without checking it back out. I'll do that so I can make some changes. Now, since my article is a structured page, I need to go to the Form tab to make my changes. This article describes different brewing methods, so I've decided to add links to these products in my store.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As I do this, I'd note that I am making an error on the page I am choosing. This is intentional, so you can see how the workflow goes into practice. Once that's done, I'll save my work and then follow the instructions to check the article in before submission. Now I can submit my changes for approval, and even add in a comment about why I made the changes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Because I am logged in as Andy, I now can't do anything more. I am only a content editor, not a manager with authorization to approve new versions for publishing. You can also see that if I open my live site, I won't see my changes appear though I can see them if I use the Page tab or Preview mode. To see how the workflow will continue, I will cancel this impersonation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I'll go back to my Application Dashboard and view my Email queue which is not accessible as Andy or Laura. If I click on the view button next to the only email here, you can see that an email would be sent to Laura, one of my managers, telling her that a page has been submitted for her approval and including the comment that Andy made. So now I'll impersonate Laura to simulate her responding to that email.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>She could click on the link in the email. Or on her Application Dashboard, you can see that the Pending pages live tile shows that there is one page waiting for attention. I'll go there and then click on the page to get taken directly to it. Here, I can see the page as it's ready for me, with the note I'd need to check it out to make changes. I can also take a look at the workflow history by clicking on Properties and going to the Workflow tab to see the comments there directly.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Note that the comment Andy made when checking the page in does not appear here, as that is not a part of the workflow but of the version history. If I go to my Page tab, I can try out one link and notice it is wrong. So then I can come up to the top and reject this change, telling Andy to fix it himself as I don't have time right now. If I cancel this impersonation and go back to my email queue, you can see the email that Andy would receive with the comment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I'll go back to being Andy and get back to my page. Then I'll check it out and just get to work on fixing this link so it points to the right place. Once I have done that, I can submit it with a comment again explaining what I'm doing. If I go right back to being Laura, I can check out the changes on the Page tab, see that they look nice, and then approve the changes with a comment thanking Andy for his work. You'll see that the article's status now changes to published, and I can see the new version on my live site. If I go back to my Workflow tab, you can see all of the steps that got me to where I am now.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So that was a look at how a page passes through workflow steps.

Let me go through and make the changes and then check the page back in. I can also add a comment to let other content editors know why I edited the text.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I can immediately see my changes on the live site as they are published automatically when I check the page in. I will now check it back out and delete a paragraph that I think is redundant. I will only save the changes this time instead of checking it in because I don't want to publish this change right now. By clicking on Properties and switching to the Versions tab, I can see a list of all of this page's versions. The current version is at the top and I cannot delete it right now. I can see the comment I added when checking in the previous version as well as some basic properties such as published from, published to and the version number.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Notice the differences in version numbers. The last version in which I deleted a paragraph is listed as a minor version and the others are major versions. Remember I only saved the last version because I didn't want to publish it so let me check in the page from here. This makes my most recent changes published and you can see that the version number has changed to reflect that this is now a major version.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Clicking on the view button allows me to view any version of the page. Notice that this shows me detailed information about the page rather than a preview of the page itself. I can also compare this version to any other version of the page. You can easily spot the paragraph I removed because the differences are in red. I can roll back to a previous version of the page from here, or I can also do it in the list of all versions by clicking on the Roll back button.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When I refresh my live site, it shows me the edited version of the page I had before I deleted a paragraph from it. I can clear the version history if it gets too long or if I am sure I've reached the final version of my page and I won't need the previous versions. I can remove only certain versions by clicking on the Delete buttons, or all of them, which will leave me with only my current version. Think twice before deleting versions or clearing your version history since you will never be able to restore the versions you delete.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now you know what versioning is and how it works.
