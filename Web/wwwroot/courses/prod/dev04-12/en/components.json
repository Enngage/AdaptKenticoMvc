Page builder allows content editors to create pages with arbitrary structures of widgets. They do it in the Pages application. On the other hand, form builder allows editors to freely create forms in the Forms application, in the Form builder tab of a given form. However, when an editor wants to publish a form in the live site, they do it through one built-in widget—Form widget.</p>\n<p>Rendering forms via the Form widget is officially supported by Kentico. However, in rare cases where either business or technical project requirements dictate to avoid having builder-enabled pages, we’ll provide you with guidance on how to publish <strong>basic</strong> forms in the traditional ASP.NET MVC ways.</p></div>\n<p><br></p>","instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"textWithCode","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true},"_isOptional":false,"_classes":"","_id":"9d7cd333-7cc1-4d78-81bb-e7f679b3080c","_parentId":"31623b98-d081-4885-ae06-05c1610c69b9","_type":"component","title":"Integration with Kentico features","displayTitle":"Integration with Kentico features"},{"body":"<p>Kentico MVC development model is based on content-only page types. Unlike Portal Engine pages (utilizing the older ASP.NET Web Forms technology), content-only pages offer a much cleaner architecture. The content is separated from its presentation. Texts and page assets are held in a structured form in the content-only pages so that they could be worked on in a uniform way and presented in more than just one form. The way the texts and assets are presented (organized) in the web pages, is the responsibility of the MVC app.</p>\n<p>Page builder brings an addition to this architecture model. Unlike the textual, numerical and other data in page fields, which the content contributors aren’t supposed to visually arrange, builder-enabled pages allow that to a very high degree.</p>\n<div class=\"infobox note\"><p>Please note that builder-enabled pages also can hold data in their page fields. They are also content-only pages, with just the page builder being enabled on top of the standard functionality.</p></div>\n<p>The only important takeaway is that widget content is stored separately from page fields. As a result, each piece of content of your website will either be stored in a page field, or in a widget state. Depending on the business requirements of your project, you can decide which parts of the overall website data should be stored in the stricter form of page fields, and which parts is better to be held in widgets.</p>\n<div class=\"infobox warning\"><h3>Performance</h3>\n<p>There are also performance considerations that you should take into account when planning the use of page builder. Page builder was primarily designed for average-sized web pages like landing pages. Technically speaking, Kentico does not put any hard limits on the total amount of text, numerical data and assets put into a single widget by content contributors. Hence, they may be tempted to utilize page builder for large-scale pages with tens of thousands of words.

The scripts, however, need to be rendered immediately before the closing tag of the <em>&lt;body /&gt;</em> element. The page builder scripts require the DOM to be fully rendered.</p></div>\n<h3>Common configuration steps</h3>\n<p>To use page builder, <strong>preview mode</strong> must be enabled, either for the site, or globally.</p>\n<p>This can be done in <em>Settings &gt; Content &gt; Content management &gt; General</em>, and check <em>Allow preview mode on the live site</em>.</p>\n<p>In the MVC app, preview gets enabled by calling an OWIN extension method on the <em>IApplicationBuilder</em> instance:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-csharp\">protected void Application_Start()\n{\n\tApplicationBuilder.Current.UsePreview();\n}</code></pre>\n<p>There is one last prerequisite to be configured in both the admin UI and the source code: <strong>the URL patterns and routes</strong>. Each builder-enabled page type should have its URL pattern specified. The pattern should be covered by MVC routes appropriately.</p>\n<p>It can be done in the admin UI in <em>Page types &gt; Edit &gt; General &gt; URL pattern</em>. To specify variable segments of the URL, <a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/macro-expressions/macro-syntax\">macro expressions</a> must be used.</p>\n<p>For instance, a pattern for translated landing pages that can be accessed through a node alias in the URL, could be specified like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-csharp\">/{%DocumentCulture%}/LandingPage/{%NodeAlias%}</code></pre>\n<p>The route counterpart of the URL pattern could be set in the <em>RouteConfig.cs</em> file in the following way:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-csharp\">// Maps route to langind pages\nroute = routes.MapRoute(\n\tname: \"LandingPage\",\n\turl: \"{culture}/LandingPage/{nodeAlias}\",\n\tdefaults: new { culture = defaultCulture.Name, controller = \"LandingPage\", action = \"Index\" },\n\tconstraints: new { culture = new SiteCultureConstraint(AppConfig.Sitename), nodeAlias = new OptionalRouteConstraint(new RegexRouteConstraint(@\"[\\w\\d_-]*\")) }\n);\n\n// A route value determines the culture of the current thread\nroute.RouteHandler = new MultiCultureMvcRouteHandler();</code></pre>\n<p>Both the above URL pattern of the landing page and its route counterpart are used in the <a href=\"https://github.com/Kentico/training-kentico-k12/tree/builders\">Medio Clinic website</a>.</p>","instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"textWithCode","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true},"_isOptional":false,"_classes":"","_id":"155d107e-5e42-455d-9009-f06f8893a9bd","_parentId":"73610315-d22d-4e41-9ad0-9bb11c32368b","_type":"component","title":"Theory: Page builder prerequisites","displayTitle":"Theory: Page builder prerequisites"},{"_canShowModelAnswer":true,"_isRandom":true,"_shouldDisplayAttempts":true,"_allowsPunctuation":true,"body":"<p>How do builder-enabled pages store and utilize their content?</p>","_attempts":3,"_questionWeight":1,"_selectable":1,"_items":[{"text":"<p>They have both the traditional page fields and widget state stored separately.

Areas may contain page sections of any shape or size.</p>\n<p>Page sections are basically rows that typically contain one or more columns. To you, MVC developers, a page section is nothing but a dead simple MVC controller with a view. In that view, you typically tell how many widget zones a page section contains and what their column width is. Of course, you're not limited to stacking widget zones into columns. You're free to compose page sections in other ways.</p>\n<p>Once editors add page sections to editable areas, they can start adding widgets to the sections. A widget is, again, a set of a controller, a view model, and a basic model which we call widget properties. Widget properties contain data used to configure (parametrize) each particular widget instance by content editors.</p>\n<p>You can allow editors to configure a widget in two ways, whichever suits you better:&nbsp;They can use either&nbsp;a configuration form, or use so-called inline editors.</p>\n<p>A configuration form is easier to implement, however, inline editors provide a better WYSIWYG experience to the user. You can of course mix and match so that one part of a widget’s configuration is done through form components and the rest with inline editors. Inline editors require a bit of JavaScript coding but not much. You can write good old plain JavaScript or you’re free to use any of your favorite frameworks.</p>\n<p>Well, that’s the whole story of Kentico page builder.</p>\n<p>As far as form builder is concerned, you can also customize it. You can develop custom form layouts through form sections, custom form components, form validation rules and field visibility conditions. Form sections are basically the same thing as page builder page sections. Form components are simply types of form fields.</p>\n<p>When developing your custom form components, you can make them collect any number of information inputs from users, as long as they boil them down to a single database value.</p>\n<p>A great thing about form components is that if required, they can be used not only in the forms of the form builder, but also to configure the properties of other form components. If you wish, you can use form components in the property configuration forms of page builder widgets. Validation rules also provide a great level of reusability. Once developed, a validation rule is usable with multiple form components, as long as a given component operates on a certain data type in the database.</p>\n<p>The development of form builder artifacts is often simpler than with page builder. A form section comprises of just a simple controller and a view. A form component involves two classes: component view model and form properties. A validation rule typically requires just one class. The same applies to visibility conditions.</p>\n<p>As you can see, there’s lots of power in page builder and form builder. In the next page you'll learn what you’ll implement throughout this course. We’ll show which piece of the solution is responsible for which piece of the final result.</p>"},"_playerOptions":{"features":["playpause","progress","current","duration","speed","volume","fullscreen"]},"instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"media","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true},"_isOptional":false,"_classes":"","_id":"60b304fc-fa03-451e-97f3-4292da8c7449","_parentId":"bad95897-e8ef-486d-81ac-0ede8abc46ae","_type":"component","title":"Page builder and form builder overview","displayTitle":"Page builder and form builder overview"},{"_setCompletionOn":"play","_useClosedCaptions":true,"_allowFullScreen":true,"_media":{"mp4":"https://assets-eu-01.kc-usercontent.com:443/63117da1-007f-01dd-86eb-23e8353ac375/dec549c1-b9df-4e68-b7a0-9c17abdafd93/page-builder-and-form-builder-code-overview.mp4","poster":"https://assets-eu-01.kc-usercontent.com:443/63117da1-007f-01dd-86eb-23e8353ac375/78dfd961-a652-415f-ba04-2dded5b78eb9/Development%20overview.png","cc":{"srclang":"en","src":null}},"_transcript":{"_setCompletionOnView":true,"_inlineTranscript":true,"_externalTranscript":false,"inlineTranscriptButton":"Transcript","InlineTranscriptCloseButton":"Close Transcript","inlineTranscriptBody":""},"_playerOptions":{"features":["playpause","progress","current","duration","speed","volume","fullscreen"]},"instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"media","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true},"_isOptional":false,"_classes":"","_id":"676fa8a9-5749-4efc-94b1-363736d3b26f","_parentId":"bad95897-e8ef-486d-81ac-0ede8abc46ae","_type":"component","title":"Page builder and form builder in Medio Clinic","displayTitle":"Page builder and form builder in Medio Clinic"},{"body":"<p>In the videos, you’ve seen the building blocks in both an abstract way and in the specific examples in the Medio Clinic website.

They also can be rather static. However, you’ll typically want them to be configurable and to take input data.</p></div>\n<h4>Widget controller</h4>\n<p>The responsibility of a <strong>widget controller</strong> is always to invoke a view. If the widget is supposed to take input and configuration tweaks from content editors, its responsibility is also to get such data as so-called <em>widget properties</em>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-csharp\">public class MyWidgetController : WidgetController&lt;MyWidgetProperties&gt;\n{\n\tpublic ActionResult Index()\n\t{\n\t\tvar properties = GetProperties();\n\n\t\treturn PartialView(\"Widgets/_MyWidget\", new MyWidgetViewModel { Text = properties.Text });\n\t}\n}</code></pre>\n<p>In order to get the properties, the controller has to inherit from <em>Kentico.PageBuilder.Web.Mvc.WidgetController&lt;TProperties&gt;</em>. (The <em>TProperties</em> generic denotes the type of the properties data.) Internally, the <em>WidgetController</em> base class works with a <em>widget properties retriever</em> class. The <em>WidgetController</em> base class then provides a <em>GetProperties</em> method that is capable of pulling the properties data out of the database.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you may want to work with page data (stored in page fields) in your widgets. To get around that, you can call the <em>GetPage</em> method of the <em>WidgetController</em> base class. It will provide you with all field data.</p>\n<h4>Widget partial view</h4>\n<p>The responsibility of the <strong>widget partial view</strong> is twofold. The views always operate in two modes—in the edit mode (in the admin UI) and in the display mode (in the live site).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-csharp\">@using MyProject.Models.InlineEditors\n@using MyProject.Models.Widgets\n@model MyProject.Models.Widgets.MyWidgetViewModel\n\n@if (Context.Kentico().PageBuilder().EditMode)\n{\n    Html.RenderPartial(\"InlineEditors/_MyTextEditor\", new MyTextEditorViewModel\n    {\n        PropertyName = nameof(MyWidgetProperties.Text),\n        Text = Model.Text\n    });\n}\nelse\n{\n    @Html.Raw(Model.Text);\n}</code></pre>\n<p>When in the live site, the view’s responsible just for rendering the Razor markup with whatever widget state came from the controller through a view model object (that has no Kentico specifics).</p>\n<p>When in the admin UI, the widget view has to allow the content editors to edit the widget state somehow. It therefore has to employ inline editors, a widget configuration form, or both. In the case of inline editors, the code of the view needs to render them through nested partial views of inline editors, with data passed to them via view models.</p>\n<h4>Widget properties model</h4>\n<p>Before we get any further in the rendering pipeline, let’s stop by the <strong>widget properties model</strong>. The class (the <em>TProperties</em> mentioned above) is designed to carry the widget’s state from the admin UI back into the Kentico database, when the content editor hits the <em>Save</em> button. In the background, the data is sent from the browser to the server as JSON. Therefore, the properties model class should reflect this structure and it therefore shouldn’t have any other kinds of properties than those supported by JSON: strings, numbers, and arrays of the two.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-csharp\">public class TextWidgetProperties : Kentico.PageBuilder.Web.Mvc.IWidgetProperties\n{\n\tpublic string Text { get; set; }\n\t\n\t[EditingComponent(Kentico.Forms.Web.Mvc.IntInputComponent.IDENTIFIER, Label = \"Font size (pt)\" )]\n\tpublic int FontSizePt { get; set; }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>Remember the mention of using the widget configuration form in the previous paragraphs? Allowing users to configure a widget through a form is the second responsibility of the properties model class. It can be accomplished by just decorating the property members of this class with <em>Kentico.Forms.Web.Mvc.EditingComponentAttribute</em> attributes. In that attribute, the type of an editing component can be specified, together with some other details. That’s all you need to render a text box, or any other form component in the configuration form, and to have its value saved to the database upon hitting <em>Save</em>.</p>\n<h4>Widget view model</h4>\n<p>This model class differs from the properties model in one significant way. It does not represent data flowing from the database into the controller, but the data that flows out of the controller to the views.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-csharp\">public class MyWidgetViewModel\n{\n\tpublic string Text { get; set; }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>The view model neither has any special behavior, nor has any special purpose. It is always a plain old C# class. It does not necessarily have to be Kentico-specific by any means.</p>\n<h4>Inline editor partial view</h4>\n<p>An inline editor’s responsibility is to allow content contributors to edit the widget state in the WYSIWYG manner, with as little technical skills required as possible.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-csharp\">@model MedioClinic.Models.InlineEditors.MyTextEditorViewModel\n\n@using (Html.Kentico().BeginInlineEditor(\"my-text-editor\", Model.PropertyName,\n    new\n    {\n        @class = \"my-text-editor\",\n        data_font_size_pt = Model.FontSizePt.ToString()\n    }))\n{\n    @Html.Raw(Model.Text)\n}</code></pre>\n<p>First, the inline editor needs to render itself. That’s why it needs a partial view and its accompanying view model class.</p>\n<h4>Inline editor view model</h4>\n<p>Everything we said about the widget view model also applies to the inline editor view model. It is just an ordinary view model that pumps data to the inline editor at render time.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-csharp\">public class MyTextEditorViewModel\n{\n\tpublic string PropertyName { get; set; }\n\tpublic string Text { get; set; }\n\tpublic int FontSizePt { get; set; } = 12;\n}</code></pre>\n<h4>Inline editor JavaScript file</h4>\n<p>As we’ve explained in the videos, the inline editor needs to capture the edits done by content contributors in the page (in the admin UI) and send the changed widget state to the central browser store. From there, it is then sent back to the server (to the database) upon hitting <em>Save</em>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">(function () {\n    window.kentico.pageBuilder.registerInlineEditor(\"text-editor\", {\n        init: function (options) {\n\t\t\tvar editorHtmlElement = options.editor;\n\t\t\tvar fontSizePt = editor.getAttribute(\"data-font-size-pt\");\n\t\t\tvar acmeTextEditor = new AcmeTextEditor(editorHtmlElement, fontSizePt);\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tacmeTextEditor.subscribe(\"textChangedByUser\", function () {\n\t\t\t\tvar event = new CustomEvent(\"updateProperty\", {\n                    detail: {\n                        name: options.propertyName,\n                        value: acmeTextEditor.getAllText(),\n                        refreshMarkup: false\n                    }\n                });\n\n                editor.dispatchEvent(event);\n\t\t\t});\n\t\t},\n\t\t\n\t\tdestroy: function (options) {\n\t\t\t// Destroy the AcmeTextEditor instance.\n\t\t}\n    });\n})();</code></pre>\n<p>There’s only one way of achieving such a goal in the browser—through JavaScript.</p>\n<p>For that purpose, each inline editor ought to have at least one such code file. From within that code file, you should call the <em>window.kentico.pageBuilder.registerInlineEditor</em> function that’s available in the global object thanks to the initialization of page builder scripts in the builder-enabled page’s view mentioned earlier in this page. In that <em>registerInlineEditor</em> function call, an argument needs to be passed that handles both the initialization of the inline editor and sending of the edited widget state to the central browser’s store. The argument has to have a form of an anonymous object with at least one property function called <em>init</em>. Apart from initializing some JavaScript rich editor component, this property function should also hook into the events emitted by the rich editor component, and make them forwarded to the browser’s central store appropriately. The forwarding is done via a new <em>CustomEvent</em> object with a well-known <em>updateProperty</em> codename. In the detail of the custom event, you can use a <em>refreshMarkup</em> boolean property to control whether a page will be refreshed upon firing such an event.</p>\n<p>When in the <em>registerInlineEditor</em> function call, you have access to an <em>options</em> JavaScript object provided by Kentico. With it, you can retrieve the name of the widget property being edited (as <em>options.propertyName</em>), the editor’s HTML element object, and the Kentico localization service (as <em>options.localizationService</em>).</p>\n<p>On top of these three things, you may also want to pass additional configuration data to the JavaScript code. The best way to do this is pass such data from the widget controller, through the widget view model and the inline editor view model, into the inline editor’s partial view, and render such data in the form of <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/data-*\">data-* HTML attributes</a> into the inline editor’s markup. Then it can be read by the JavaScript code easily.</p>\n<p>Initialization aside, the JavaScript file may also handle the process of destroying the inline editor, and the process of dragging and dropping it within the web page.</p>\n<p>To sum the JavaScript file up, its responsibility is to forward events emitted by JavaScript components and rich editors to the browser’s central store. As for touch points, there are basically two of them: taking the data from Kentico (with the <em>options</em> object and possibly with the <em>data-* </em>attributes in hand), and providing updated data back to Kentico (through the <em>updateProperty</em> custom event).</p>","instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"textWithCode","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true},"_isOptional":false,"_classes":"","_id":"0ad8fe8e-4137-4ed3-bd77-0525fee8d19e","_parentId":"c2369530-8fd1-4935-b2d4-e7340799e140","_type":"component","title":"Widgets","displayTitle":"Widgets"},{"body":"<p>The page builder is undoubtedly a powerful feature, therefore the artifacts involved in page builder made up quite a large list.

If your business requirements go beyond what the components shipped with Kentico can handle, then you can develop your custom components.</p>\n<p>However unlikely it may seem, you won’t face any bulky complexity when developing components. In the source code, the component may be represented by only two classes and one view. One of the classes being the component view model (the core of the component) and the second being its accompanying properties class.</p>\n<h4>Component view model class</h4>\n<p>In the view model class, you just define one or more property members. By stating “one or more”, we mean that in the live site, a component does not necessarily have to show up as only one form input HTML element. It can be several input elements that your class boils to a single primitive database value.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-csharp\">using Kentico.Forms.Web.Mvc;\n\n[assembly: RegisterFormComponent(\n\t\"MyFormComponent\", \n\ttypeof(MyFormComponent), \n\t\"My form component\", \n\tDescription = \"My custom form component.\", \n\tIconClass = \"icon-picture\")]\n\n...\n\npublic class MyFormComponent : FormComponent&lt;MyFormComponentProperties, string&gt;\n{\n\t[BindableProperty]\n\tpublic string Text { get; set; } = string.Empty;\n\n\tpublic override string GetValue() =&gt; Text;\n\n\tpublic override void SetValue(string value)\n\t{\n\t\tText = value;\n\t}\n}</code></pre>\n<p>The main <strong>responsibility of the model class</strong> is to carry the value(s) from and into the database. In order to do that, you should:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Base your class on <em>Kentico.Forms.Web.Mvc.FormComponent&lt;TProperties, TValue&gt;</em></li>\n  <li>Create one or more property members with the <em>Kentico.Forms.Web.Mvc.BindablePropertyAttribute</em> attached</li>\n  <li>Override the <em>SetValue</em> method that is responsible for transferring (and if necessary transforming) the database value to the form field value(s)</li>\n  <li>Override the <em>GetValue</em> method that does the opposite</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"infobox note\"><p>The methods were named from the database’s perspective. Therefore, the <em>GetValue</em> method gets the value(s) from the <em>bindable properties</em> into the database.</p></div>\n<p>The <em>GetValue </em>and <em>SetValue</em> methods also form the main <strong>touch points</strong> of this class. There is also another touch point: the reference to the component properties class specified as the generic parameter of the <em>FormComponent</em> base class (<em>TProperties</em>).</p>\n<p>So much for the view model class. Let’s now get onto the properties class.</p>\n<h4>Component properties class</h4>\n<p>The naming of the class may resemble widget properties classes. But you shouldn’t get misled by the naming. In this case, the <strong>purpose and responsibility</strong> of the properties class is to allow content editors to configure your form component in a specific form in the <em>Forms</em> application.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-csharp\">using Kentico.Forms.Web.Mvc;\n\npublic class MyFormComponentProperties : FormComponentProperties&lt;string&gt;\n{\n\tpublic MyFormComponentProperties() : base(FieldDataType.Text, 200)\n\t{\n\t}\n\n\t[DefaultValueEditingComponent(TextAreaComponent.IDENTIFIER)]\n\tpublic override string DefaultValue { get; set; } = string.Empty;\n\n\t[EditingComponent(IntInputComponent.IDENTIFIER, Label = \"Number of rows of the text area\")]\n\t[Required]\n\tpublic int TextAreaRows { get; set; }\n\t\n\t[EditingComponent(IntInputComponent.IDENTIFIER, Label = \"Number of columns of the text area\")]\n\t[Required]\n\tpublic int TextAreaColumns { get; set; }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>It comes as no surprise that you can do that by adding property members to your class and decorating them with attributes. In the same way as before. On top of the configuration properties, you can also override the <em>DefaultValue</em> property of the <em>Kentico.Forms.Web.Mvc.FormComponentProperties&lt;TValue&gt; </em>base class. The <em>DefaultValue</em> property has to be of type <em>TValue</em>.</p>\n<p>However, an equally important part is the class constructor. In it, the nature of the TValue needs to be further specified, so that Kentico can create proper database schemas. You’ll learn all details in a later page of this course.</p>\n<h4>Component partial view</h4>\n<p>The view does the plumbing of the HTML input element(s).</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-csharp\">@using MyProject.Models.FormComponents\n@model MyFormComponent\n\n@{\n    var htmlAttributes = ViewData.GetEditorHtmlAttributes();\n}\n\n@Html.TextAreaFor(model =&gt; model.Text, Model.Properties.TextAreaRows, Model.Properties.TextAreaColumns, htmlAttributes)</code></pre>\n<p>Its purpose is to render appropriate markup, and alter its contents based on the specific form field’s configuration.</p>\n<p>The configuration data, which was set by content editors in the Forms application, can be reached at runtime, via the <em>Properties</em> property of the form component’s model object.</p>\n<h4>Optional component’s JavaScript file</h4>\n<p>For the most part, you’ll be fine with just the backend code files we’ve just enumerated. However, you may want to add client-side functionality at times. You’re absolutely free to do so and there aren’t any hard requirements or constraints that you have to obey to complement your component with frontend functionality.</p>","instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"textWithCode","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true},"_isOptional":false,"_classes":"","_id":"d06a3af6-8a4d-457e-8165-efc636ae4ed1","_parentId":"4453bb58-f296-40e2-a297-ea7971ab84f5","_type":"component","title":"Form component","displayTitle":"Form component"},{"body":"<p>If you’re interested in getting an alternative explanation of the architecture of builders, the following two links will give a good head start:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/developing-websites/page-builder-development/developing-widgets-in-mvc\">Page builder development</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/developing-websites/form-builder-development\">Form builder development</a>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>","instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"textWithCode","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true},"_isOptional":false,"_classes":"","_id":"ad528d77-3386-4682-88e3-0260f42ec2ca","_parentId":"6c8037d4-f369-4776-825e-64dfe42cbafa","_type":"component","title":"Builders in the Kentico documentation","displayTitle":"Builders in the Kentico documentation"},{"body":"<p>By watching the above videos and reading the chapters, you may have deemed page builder and form builder too aligned with ASP.NET MVC best practices.

The XML syntax, primarily designed to address that ceremony, was unfortunately too declarative, and forced developers to do lots of workarounds. It resulted in heavy compromises on code brevity, maintainability and performance.</p>\n<p>MVC was built with the “convention over configuration” principle in mind.

Therefore, you need different JavaScript functionality to support that. A great deal of such functionality can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.dropzonejs.com/\">Dropzone.js</a> component available on the Internet. It works in the way that for a given HTML element, you just create its JavaScript object, together with some configuration.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var dropzoneElement = document.getElementById(\"myId\");\n\nvar dropzone = new Dropzone(dropzoneElement, {\n\tacceptedFiles: \".jpg, .gif\",\n\turl: \"https://my-url/upload\"\n});</code></pre>\n<p>It supports both drag-n-drop and <a href=\"https://www.dropzonejs.com/#config-clickable\">picking files</a> via a native modal dialog.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var dropzoneElement = document.getElementById(\"myId\");\nvar clickableModalDialog = dropzoneElement.querySelector(\".dz-clickable\");\n\nvar dropzone = new Dropzone(dropzoneElement, {\n\tacceptedFiles: \".jpg, .gif\",\n\turl: \"https://my-url/upload\",\n\tclickable: clickableModalDialog\n});</code></pre>\n<p>It also emits events of both <a href=\"https://www.dropzonejs.com/#event-success\">successful</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dropzonejs.com/#event-error\">erroneous</a> uploads.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">dropzone.on(\"success\", function (event) {\n\tvar responseContent = JSON.parse(event.xhr.response);\n});</code></pre>\n<h4>Backend functionality</h4>\n<p>The other significant difference lies in the way the input data is transferred to Kentico. While the text widget can cope with just the properties class to carry the text from the browser to the database, the image widget will have to have a dedicated controller listening in the background for the image uploads.</p>\n<p>The Dropzone component will have to upload the image files to the controller, and trade it for an identifier of the uploaded file in Kentico. As the files will be stored as page attachments, the controller will simply return the attachment’s GUID. The identifier will then be the only information passed through the properties class to the widget’s state in the database.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-csharp\">// POST: ImageUploader/Upload\n[HttpPost]\npublic ActionResult Upload(int pageId)\n{\n\tTreeNode page = DocumentHelper.GetDocument(pageId, null);\n\tGuid imageGuid = FileManagementHelper.AddUnsortedAttachment(page, \"C:\\Temp\", Request.Files[0] as HttpPostedFileWrapper);\n\n\treturn Json(new { guid = imageGuid }); \n}</code></pre>\n<p>When implementing the inline editor, you’ll face one important issue: how to protect your image uploader controller against malicious requests. It might seem as a hard problem, but it is not. As the inline editor will only run in the edit mode in the admin UI, you get around that easily by using the <a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/developing-websites/retrieving-content-in-mvc-applications/adding-preview-mode-support#Addingpreviewmodesupport-Loadingthelatestversionsofpages\">Kentico.Content.Web.Mvc.UrlHelperPreviewExtensions.AuthenticateUrl</a> helper method. This method can decorate your upload URL with additional security information so that the preview tab in the <em>Pages</em> application stays the one and only valid source of the requests.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-csharp\">string url = Url.Kentico().AuthenticateUrl(Url.Action(\"Upload\", \"ImageUploader\", new\n\t{\n\t\tpageId = Context.Kentico().PageBuilder().PageIdentifier\n\t}), false);</code></pre>\n<p>Apart from the authentication of the upload URL itself via server-side code (typically in the partial view of your inline editor), there need to be means of using the URL in the inline editor’s JavaScript code. To transfer such configuration, you can put it into the editor’s markup as a <em>data-*</em> HTML attribute, and retrieve its value later in the JavaScript file.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-csharp\">@using (Html.Kentico().BeginInlineEditor(\"image-uploader-editor\", Model.PropertyName, new\n    {\n        data_upload_url = url\n    }))\n{\n\t&lt;div class=\"uploader\" /&gt;\n}</code></pre>\n<p>All right. If you’re up for the challenge, feel free to develop the widget yourself. If not, don’t worry.

In these registrations, you’ve hard-coded the section or widget names and descriptions.</p>\n<p>You also added string literals into various places in the source code.</p>\n<p>These literals can also be localized.</p>\n<h4>Data location</h4>\n<p>The first question that comes to mind when thinking of localization is <strong>where</strong> the localized data comes from.</p>\n<p>As a quick refresher, the localized texts can be <a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/multilingual-websites/setting-up-a-multilingual-user-interface/working-with-resource-strings\">stored</a> in two following ways in Kentico:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>In .resx files in your MVC app’s source code</li>\n  <li>In the Kentico database, via the <em>Localization</em> application</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The way the texts are identified is the same in both the .resx files and the <em>Localization</em> application. Each piece of reusable text has its key and several values (one value per culture).</p>\n<div class=\"infobox note\"><p>Both ways have their pros and cons.</p>\n<p>While the texts in the database can be easily managed in the <em>Localization</em> application, they fall short when it comes to portability of the data. For instance, if you plan on distributing your widgets in the company (or publicly), your best bet is to place the UI texts into .resx files, not into the database.</p></div>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>Another arising question is <strong>how</strong> you go about translating the texts in the source code.</p>\n<p>When page builder and form builder artifacts are <a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/multilingual-websites/setting-up-a-multilingual-user-interface/localizing-mvc-builder-components#LocalizingMVCbuildercomponents-Localizingbuildercomponentmetadata\">registered in the system</a>, their metadata (e.g., names and descriptions) can be translated by replacing the original string literals with <a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/multilingual-websites/setting-up-a-multilingual-user-interface/localizing-text-fields\">macro expressions</a>. The format consists of curly braces and a dollar sign. Like so:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-csharp\">\"{$KeyOfTranslatedText}\"</code></pre>\n<p>In the case of widget registration, the result might look like the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-csharp\">[assembly: RegisterWidget(\n\t\"MyWidget\", \n\ttypeof(MyWidget), \n\t\"{$Widget.MyWidget.Name$}\", \n\tDescription = \"{$Widget.MyWidget.Description$}\", \n\tIconClass = \"icon-carousel\")]</code></pre>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/multilingual-websites/setting-up-a-multilingual-user-interface/localizing-mvc-builder-components\">other cases in your server-side code</a>, you can easily call methods in the <em>CMS.Helpers.ResHelper</em> static class. The class is capable of retrieving the localized texts from <a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/multilingual-websites/setting-up-a-multilingual-user-interface/working-with-resource-strings\">both the .resx files and the database</a>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/multilingual-websites/setting-up-a-multilingual-user-interface/localizing-mvc-builder-components#LocalizingMVCbuildercomponents-Localizinginlineeditorscripts\">JavaScript files of inline editors</a> can also leverage the localization capabilities of Kentico.</p>\n<p>Translation can be done via the <em>options</em> object in the <em>Init</em>, <em>destroy</em>, <em>dragStart</em>, and <em>drop</em> functions. The <em>options</em> object exposes the <em>localizationService</em> property with its <em>getString</em> method. The method takes just the key of the translated text as a parameter and returns the version of the current culture.</p>\n<p>In rare cases where the <em>options</em> object is not available, you may reach the data of the localization service by calling into a <em>window.localization.strings[]</em> array. You can use the resource key of the resource string as the array entry accessor.</p>\n<div class=\"infobox note\"><p>When localizing builder artifact metadata and partial views, both .resx files and the database can serve as the source of data.</p>\n<p>However, in inline editor JavaScript files, the only option is .resx files.</p></div>\n<div class=\"infobox idea\"><p>Putting string literals into .resx files (or the database) also reduces the need to compile the app after each text revision.</p></div>\n<div class=\"infobox note\"><p>Translation from the default language into other languages is done simply by creating subfolders in the <em>App_Data &gt; Global &gt; Resources</em> folder (or <em>App_Data &gt; [site name] &gt; Resources</em>, respectively).

While visibility conditions work in real time, smart fields apply during repeated visits of a given site visitor to the page with the form in question. Simply put, in contrast to fields with visibility conditions, smart fields are hidden or displayed in a way that progressively presents different parts of the form on subsequent visits.</p></div>","instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"textWithCode","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true},"_isOptional":false,"_classes":"","_id":"f023517b-4384-4d62-80f3-011ded6204d3","_parentId":"8246d72d-3b0f-4ff2-9065-798d44cdc0d8","_type":"component","title":"Field visibility conditions","displayTitle":"Field visibility conditions"},{"body":"<p>Form components are at the core of form builder. They represent the form fields themselves. By adding instances of form components to the form in the Form builder tab, users create fields.</p>\n<p>Kentico ships with 10 built-in form components:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Checkbox</em></li>\n  <li><em>Consent agreement</em></li>\n  <li><em>Drop-down list</em></li>\n  <li><em>Email</em></li>\n  <li><em>Numeric input</em></li>\n  <li><em>Radio buttons</em></li>\n  <li><em>reCAPTCHA</em></li>\n  <li><em>Text area</em></li>\n  <li><em>Text input</em></li>\n  <li><em>U.S. phone number</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/developing-websites/form-builder-development/developing-form-components\">Form components</a> can be used not only on the <em>Form builder</em> tab. They convey configuration of widgets (in their configuration forms), form validation rules, and visibility conditions. Lastly, form components can be used to configure other form components. In this role, they are called <em>editing components</em>.</p>\n<p>A form component requires two classes:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>A form component view model</li>\n  <li>A form component properties class</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first class is the center point. It holds the data of the form field. It also plays a role of the broker between the UI and the database.</p>\n<p>The properties class provides configuration for the form component.</p>\n<p>The UI of the form component is handled with a partial view placed under <em>Views &gt; Shared &gt; FormComponents</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Form component view model class</h4>\n<p>This <a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/developing-websites/form-builder-development/developing-form-components/defining-form-component-properties\">class</a> must inherit from <em>Kentico.Forms.Web.Mvc.FormComponent&lt;TProperties, TValue&gt;</em>. In this contract, <em>TProperties</em> is the form component properties class, and <em>TValue</em> means the type of the underlying database field.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-csharp\">using Kentico.Forms.Web.Mvc;\n\n[assembly: RegisterFormComponent(\n\t\"MyFormComponent\", \n\ttypeof(MyFormComponent), \n\t\"My form component\", \n\tDescription = \"My custom form component.\", \n\tIconClass = \"icon-picture\")]\n\n...\n\npublic class MyFormComponent : FormComponent&lt;MyFormComponentProperties, string&gt;\n{\n\t[BindableProperty]\n\tpublic string Text { get; set; } = string.Empty;\n\n\tpublic override string GetValue() =&gt; Text;\n\n\tpublic override void SetValue(string value)\n\t{\n\t\tText = value;\n\t}\n}</code></pre>\n<p>It goes without much saying that this class also requires an assembly-level registration attribute.</p>\n<p>In the body of the class, there might be one or more property members, decorated with <em>Kentico.Forms.Web.Mvc.BindablePropertyAttribute</em>. They contain the data of the form field. Form components—in a close alignment to their name—can therefore be composed of multiple input data (coming from multiple HTML elements). An example of such component is the <a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/developing-websites/form-builder-development/developing-form-components/example-developing-a-custom-form-component\">RGB input form component</a> showcased in the official Kentico documentation.</p>\n<p>The role of the broker between the UI and the database is accomplished via two methods that must be overridden:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><em>GetValue</em>, used to retrieve the values from the UI and put them into the database</li>\n  <li><em>SetValue</em>, used to do it the other way around</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"infobox note\"><p>These methods were named from the UI perspective, hence such semantics of the&nbsp;<em>SetValue</em>&nbsp;method.</p></div>\n<p>Kentico calls the <em>GetValue</em> method every time the user updates the form fields, not just when the Submit button is pressed. This is due to the visibility conditions that were designed to kick in in real time. The automatic posting can be switched off by overriding the <em>CustomAutoPostHandling</em> boolean property and setting it to <em>false</em>.</p>\n<h4>Form component properties class</h4>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.kentico.com/k12/developing-websites/form-builder-development/developing-form-components/defining-form-component-properties\">properties class</a> facilitates the configuration of the form component. It must inherit from <em>Kentico.Forms.Web.Mvc.FormComponentProperties&lt;TValue&gt;</em> where <em>TValue</em> means the same thing as in the view model class—the data type of the database field.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-csharp\">using Kentico.Forms.Web.Mvc;\n\npublic class MyFormComponentProperties : FormComponentProperties&lt;string&gt;\n{\n\tpublic MyFormComponentProperties() : base(FieldDataType.Text, 200)\n\t{\n\t}\n\n\t[DefaultValueEditingComponent(TextAreaComponent.IDENTIFIER)]\n\tpublic override string DefaultValue { get; set; } = string.Empty;\n\n\t[EditingComponent(IntInputComponent.IDENTIFIER, Label = \"Number of rows of the text area\")]\n\t[Required]\n\tpublic int TextAreaRows { get; set; }\n\t\n\t[EditingComponent(IntInputComponent.IDENTIFIER, Label = \"Number of columns of the text area\")]\n\t[Required]\n\tpublic int TextAreaColumns { get; set; }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>However, to further specify the nature of the <em>TValue</em> data, the class should contain an implicit constructor that in turn calls the base class’ constructor, passing around a <em>CMS.DataEngine.FieldDataType</em> enumeration value as an argument.</p>\n<p>By overriding the <em>DefaultValue</em> property, developers can set the initial value that can be re-configured later by content editors in the <em>Form builder</em> tab.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, the class may contain property members decorated with <em>Kentico.Forms.Web.Mvc.EditingComponentAttribute</em> and <em>System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations</em> attributes. This way, other form components can be utilized to configure the current form component (they play the role of an <em>editing component</em>).</p>\n<h4>Form component partial view</h4>\n<p>The partial view needs to be named after the fully-qualified type name of the form component view model class, with an underscore prefix (e.g. <em>“_MedioClinic.FormComponent.MediaLibraryUploader.cshtml”</em>).

Such a model gives developers a great head-start to add the form to the project in the traditional MVC fashion.</p>\n<p>The best way to do forms in traditional ASP.NET MVC is with annotated view models, and an MVC feature called display/editor templates.</p>\n<p>With MVC editor templates in play, the developer just gives the MVC runtime a view model and a very simple view. In the Razor view, developers only write the surrounding HTML markup, and put the references to properties of the model into it, without caring about their types. The MVC runtime then automatically renders proper HTML controls (with proper validation behavior), based on the model.</p>\n<p>A very basic example of editor templates can be demonstrated with the following view model:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-csharp\">public class Contact\n{\n\tpublic string FirstName { get; set; }\n\tpublic string LastName { get; set; }\n\tpublic int Age { get; set; }\n}</code></pre>\n<p>With such a model, the form’s view can be as simple as the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-csharp\">@model Contact\n@Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model.FirstName)\n@Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model.LastName)\n@Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model.Age)</code></pre>\n<p>In fact, the view can be even simpler. Like so:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-csharp\">@model Contact\n@Html.DisplayForModel()</code></pre>\n<p>This is pretty much everything the MVC framework needs. It uses built-in editor templates and produces the complete HTML markup of the form:</p>\n<figure data-asset-id=\"fdb5b20c-f77e-4994-a3b0-6556df884803\" data-image-id=\"fdb5b20c-f77e-4994-a3b0-6556df884803\"><img src=\"https://assets-eu-01.kc-usercontent.com:443/63117da1-007f-01dd-86eb-23e8353ac375/b691a9ab-0120-406b-b80a-28750fce8514/036.png\" data-asset-id=\"fdb5b20c-f77e-4994-a3b0-6556df884803\" data-image-id=\"fdb5b20c-f77e-4994-a3b0-6556df884803\" alt=\"\"></figure>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Developers can of course override the default templates by writing simple Razor files, named after CLR types they operate on (again, it can be either a framework type, or a custom class or struct). When placed into a conventional file system location, these Razor files are then picked automatically by the MVC runtime every time it comes across data of such a type anywhere deep in the whole view model.</p>\n<p>The above code snippet uses a model in which the CLR types of the <em>FirstName</em>, <em>LastName</em>, and <em>Age</em> properties provide complete information about their nature. However, in cases like email address form fields, URL fields, password fields, or hidden fields, developers may want to tell the MVC framework to take additional measures in respect to formatting and validating the values in the form.</p>\n<p>To instruct MVC in such ways, one needs to annotate the model with <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.componentmodel.dataannotations\">System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations</a> attributes.</p>\n<p>The following code snippet demonstrates some of the capabilities of data annotations.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-csharp\">public bool Boolean { get; set; }\n\n[DataType(DataType.EmailAddress)]\npublic string EmailAddress { get; set; }\n\npublic decimal Decimal { get; set; }\n\n[HiddenInput]\npublic string Hidden { get; set; }\n\n[HiddenInput(DisplayValue = false)]\npublic string HiddenAndInvisible { get; set; }\n\n[DataType(DataType.Html)]\npublic string Html { get; set; }\n\n[Required]\n[Range(10, 100)]\npublic int Integer { get; set; }\n\n[DataType(DataType.MultilineText)]\npublic string MultilineText { get; set; }\n\npublic bool? NullableBoolean { get; set; }\n\n[DataType(DataType.Password)]\npublic string Password { get; set; }\n\npublic string String { get; set; }\n\n[DataType(DataType.Url)]\npublic string Url { get; set; }</code></pre>\n<p>These annotations, together with built-in editor templates, would produce a form like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-csharp\">//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n// &lt;auto-generated&gt;\n//\n//     This code was generated by code generator tool.\n//\n//     To customize the code use your own partial class.

It will search for Razor files named after the types of the properties, and it will render them. Otherwise, it will fall back to the built-in templates.</p>\n<p>It will search in the following locations in the project:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Areas &gt; [AreaName] &gt; Views &gt; [ControllerName] &gt; DisplayTemplates</li>\n  <li>Areas &gt; [AreaName] &gt; Views &gt; Shared &gt; DisplayTemplates</li>\n  <li>Views &gt; [ControllerName] &gt; DisplayTemplates</li>\n  <li>Views &gt; Shared &gt; DisplayTemplates</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With the second option, it will do the same for each particular property in the model.</p>\n<p>Calling <em>Html.EditorFor()</em> per each property makes sense in cases where more control over the HTML markup is required. For instance, the developer may want to add horizontal rules between form fields. Such markup can be enclosed in either a partial view, so that the partial view can be explicitly invoked by the developer, or it can be put into an editor template of its own, to be invoked by MVC automatically, whenever it sees data of a corresponding CLR type anywhere in the view model.</p>\n<p>This theory chapter was an excerpt of a bigger topic of MVC display/editor templates and data annotations in MVC. To take all the benefits, we highly recommend reading a <a href=\"https://bradwilson.typepad.com/blog/2009/10/aspnet-mvc-2-templates-part-1-introduction.html\">short blogpost series</a> (about an hour of reading) of the original author of this feature, Brad Wilson. The series was written in the days of MVC 2, however, nearly all of the concepts are the same in MVC 5 (except for Razor being a preferred view engine in MVC 5). For a detailed explanation of these concepts in Kentico MVC projects, we recommend reading a two-part blogpost series published on <a href=\"https://devnet.kentico.com/articles/render-online-forms-with-asp-net-mvc-display-templates-and-the-code-generator—part-1\">DevNet</a>. Some of the concepts presented in the article remain valid for the current version of Kentico.</p>","instruction":"","_layout":"full","_component":"textWithCode","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true},"_isOptional":false,"_classes":"","_id":"63ee83c5-5cb0-47ce-9b6d-db307feadf0d","_parentId":"24c0228d-ab2c-4e47-a03a-85de5bf504f9","_type":"component","title":"Traditional ASP.NET MVC forms","displayTitle":"Traditional ASP.NET MVC forms"},{"body":"<p>In this task, your goal is to do a quick proof of the built-in capabilities in ASP.NET MVC, not a full-blown page with all the elements and styling.</p>\n<p>You’re supposed to:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Generate the model of a form&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>Create a form repository and a view model</li>\n  <li>Annotate the view model to leverage the built-in formatting and validation capabilities of ASP.NET MVC</li>\n  <li>Create a controller, to form a temporary test bench of the future form</li>\n  <li>Let Visual Studio scaffold a simple view</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As usual, if you don’t feel like exploring things yourself, you can follow along in the next demo chapter.</p>\n<div class=\"infobox warning\"><p>We strongly recommend rendering Kentico forms through the <em>Form</em> widget (in builder-enabled pages), not in the traditional ASP.NET MVC fashion.
